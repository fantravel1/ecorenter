        <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.6rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">The most radical act in food is knowing where it comes from.</h2>
        <blockquote class="story-quote">
          "When you pull a carrot from the soil, wash it under rainwater, and cook it over a wood fire you built yourself, something shifts in your understanding of food. It is no longer a commodity. It is a relationship between soil, sun, water, and your own hands. Every meal becomes an act of gratitude, and waste becomes unthinkable."
        </blockquote>
        <p class="story-attribution">&mdash; Chef Maria Elena, Organic Farm Kitchen, Costa Rica</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Globally, one-third of all food produced is wasted, accounting for 8-10% of greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional food cultures, however, evolved zero-waste practices over centuries: fermenting, drying, smoking, pickling, and composting. Our sustainable cooking classes reconnect travelers with these ancient wisdoms, taught by local chefs who inherited them from grandmothers, not textbooks. Across six destinations, each class begins in the garden or forest, moves through the kitchen, and ends at a communal table where nothing is wasted and everything is shared.</p>

          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Costa Rica: Tropical Farm Kitchen</h3>
            <p>Cook over wood fires at an organic finca in the Central Valley. Harvest cacao for handmade chocolate, pick tropical fruits at dawn, and learn gallo pinto from a third-generation farm family. Ferment hot sauces, smoke meats using guava wood, and prepare heart-of-palm ceviche with foraged herbs. All ingredients come from the 12-acre organic farm or its neighbors within 10 kilometers.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Bali: Spice Garden Cuisine</h3>
            <p>In a traditional Balinese compound surrounded by rice terraces, learn to grind fresh spice pastes by hand using a stone mortar. Harvest lemongrass, galangal, turmeric, and torch ginger from the garden. Prepare ceremonial offerings and daily meals using banana leaves instead of plates. Master tempeh fermentation and learn why Balinese cuisine generates almost zero waste by design.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Portugal: Atlantic Preservation</h3>
            <p>In a cork-country quinta near Sintra, learn centuries-old Portuguese preservation: salting cod, smoking sausage, canning sardines, and fermenting wine. Forage for wild mushrooms, samphire, and herbs along coastal cliffs. Cook in a traditional wood-fired bread oven. Understand how Portugal's Age of Exploration was powered by food preservation techniques you can replicate at home.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Mexico: Ancestral Milpa Cooking</h3>
            <p>In Oaxaca's highlands, learn the ancient milpa system: corn, beans, and squash grown together for 7,000 years. Nixtamalize corn for tortillas, grind mole ingredients on volcanic stone, and ferment tepache from pineapple rinds. Visit a mezcal distillery using ancestral methods. Every dish connects to pre-Columbian food systems that remain among the most sustainable ever developed.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Kenya: Swahili Coastal Kitchen</h3>
            <p>On the Kenyan coast near Watamu, cook Swahili fusion dishes blending African, Arab, Indian, and Portuguese flavors. Learn to prepare coconut-based curries, smoke fish using mangrove charcoal alternatives, and bake chapati over open flame. Visit a community spice garden and learn how Swahili traders created one of the world's first global fusion cuisines centuries before the term existed.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Colombia: Andean Altitude Gastronomy</h3>
            <p>In the coffee region near Manizales, cook at 2,000 meters where altitude changes everything: boiling points, fermentation rates, and growing seasons. Harvest coffee cherries for cascara tea, prepare arepas from heirloom corn, and learn to cook with 30 varieties of potato. Forage for wild blackberries and guava in cloud forest margins. Every meal is a lesson in altitude-adapted agriculture.</p>

    <!-- What You Learn -->
    <section class="section section--dark" aria-labelledby="learn-heading">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="section-header">
          <span class="section-label">Your Journey</span>
          <h2 id="learn-heading">What You Will Learn in Every Class</h2>
          <p>Core sustainable kitchen skills taught across all six destinations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="philosophy-grid">
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>1. Garden-to-Plate Sourcing</h3>
            <p>Every class begins with a guided tour of the organic garden, farm, or local market. You learn to identify seasonal produce, understand growing cycles, and select ingredients at peak ripeness. This direct connection between soil and plate transforms how you think about grocery shopping and meal planning for the rest of your life.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>2. Wild Foraging and Identification</h3>
            <p>Trained foragers lead walks through forests, coastlines, and fields to identify edible wild plants, mushrooms, seaweeds, and herbs. You learn safe identification protocols, sustainable harvesting practices that protect wild populations, and how to incorporate foraged ingredients into daily cooking. Each destination offers unique foraging environments and species.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>3. Traditional Preservation Techniques</h3>
            <p>Before refrigeration, every culture developed preservation methods to survive lean seasons. You learn fermentation (kimchi, sauerkraut, tepache, kombucha), smoking (fish, meats, chiles), dehydration (fruits, herbs, mushrooms), salting, and pickling. These techniques reduce food waste, extend shelf life naturally, and create complex flavors without artificial additives.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>4. Zero-Waste Kitchen Management</h3>
            <p>Every scrap has a purpose. Vegetable trimmings become stock. Citrus peels become cleaning products. Coffee grounds fertilize the garden. Bones become broth. Stale bread becomes croutons or thickening agents. You learn a systematic approach to eliminating kitchen waste that you can implement immediately in your home kitchen, saving money while reducing your environmental footprint.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>5. Energy-Efficient Cooking Methods</h3>
            <p>Learn to cook with solar ovens, retained-heat cookers, rocket stoves, and biogas systems. Understand how traditional cooking methods often use less energy than modern appliances. Practice one-pot cooking techniques that minimize energy use while maximizing flavor. Each destination demonstrates locally appropriate energy solutions for the kitchen.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>6. Communal Dining and Food Culture</h3>
            <p>Every class ends with a shared meal where all participants eat together. This is not incidental: communal dining reduces per-person food waste by 30% compared to individual meals. You experience how food culture, conversation, and shared plates create deeper satisfaction with less consumption. These communal traditions offer a powerful alternative to individualized food systems.</p>

                <p>You will learn farm-to-table cooking techniques including wild ingredient foraging and identification, traditional food preservation methods such as fermentation, smoking, and dehydration, zero-waste kitchen management, seasonal menu planning, composting, and plant-forward meal preparation. Each destination adds region-specific techniques like Costa Rican wood-fire cooking, Balinese spice paste preparation, or Portuguese preserving traditions.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>No prior cooking experience is required. Classes are designed for all skill levels, from complete beginners to experienced home cooks. Each session begins with foundational techniques before building to more complex preparations. Local chefs provide hands-on guidance throughout. The emphasis is on sustainable principles and traditional methods rather than professional culinary technique.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Sustainable cooking classes are available across six destinations: Costa Rica (tropical farm kitchen), Bali (spice garden cuisine), Portugal (Atlantic preservation), Mexico (ancestral milpa cooking), Kenya (Swahili coastal kitchen), and Colombia (Andean altitude gastronomy). Each location offers unique ingredients, techniques, and cultural contexts.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Every class operates on zero-waste principles. Ingredients are sourced from on-site organic gardens or local regenerative farms within 25 kilometers. No single-use plastics are used. All organic waste is composted and returned to the garden. Energy comes from solar, biogas, or sustainably harvested wood. The carbon footprint of each class is calculated and offset through local reforestation projects.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Each cooking class lasts 4-6 hours and includes a guided garden or market tour to source ingredients, a foraging walk, hands-on cooking instruction with a local chef, a communal meal featuring everything you prepared, printed recipe cards, and a small jar of preserves or fermented ingredients you made. Multi-day intensives of 3-5 days are available at each destination for deeper immersion.</p>
