        <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.6rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Mangroves are the unsung heroes of climate resilience.</h2>
        <blockquote class="story-quote">
          "People plant trees in forests and feel good about it. But when you plant a mangrove, you are doing something far more powerful. You are building a wall against storm surges, a nursery for fish that feed millions, a carbon vault that outperforms any tropical forest, and a water filter that protects coral reefs downstream. One tree, four miracles."
        </blockquote>
        <p class="story-attribution">&mdash; Professor Amara Osei, Marine Ecologist, University of Nairobi</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">The world has lost over 35% of its mangrove forests since 1980, primarily to shrimp farming, coastal development, and pollution. This destruction releases massive amounts of stored carbon and strips coastlines of their natural storm defense. Our restoration programs in Colombia, Mexico, and Kenya are reversing this trend, one seedling at a time, while training local communities in sustainable mangrove management that provides long-term economic alternatives to destruction.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="philosophy-grid">
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>The Setting</h3>
            <p>Colombia's Caribbean coast once boasted vast mangrove forests that protected cities like Cartagena from hurricanes and storm surges. Decades of urban expansion and shrimp farming destroyed much of this natural barrier. Our restoration program operates in the Cienaga de la Virgen and surrounding estuaries, working to rebuild what was lost while creating sustainable livelihoods for fishing communities displaced by mangrove destruction.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Nursery Operations</h3>
            <p>Volunteers help manage community-run mangrove nurseries that propagate four native species: red mangrove, black mangrove, white mangrove, and buttonwood. You learn to collect propagules from mature trees, prepare nursery beds, monitor germination rates, and harden seedlings for transplanting. Each nursery produces over 10,000 seedlings per season, with survival rates exceeding 85% thanks to careful site selection and planting techniques.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Planting and Monitoring</h3>
            <p>Planting sessions occur during low tide windows, when volunteers wade into designated restoration zones to install seedlings at precise spacing intervals. Post-planting monitoring tracks growth rates, survival percentages, and colonization by marine species. Within two years, restored mangrove plots typically show measurable increases in fish, crab, and bird populations.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Community Fisheries Integration</h3>
            <p>The program works closely with local fishing cooperatives, demonstrating that restored mangroves directly increase fish catches in adjacent waters. Former mangrove clearers now serve as restoration guides and nursery managers. This economic transformation is perhaps the program's most important achievement: proving that living mangroves are worth more than cleared land.</p>

          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Carbon Sequestration Education</h3>
            <p>All programs include workshops on blue carbon science, teaching volunteers how mangrove ecosystems capture and store atmospheric carbon in their biomass and sediments. You learn to measure carbon stocks using standard field protocols and understand how mangrove restoration fits into global climate mitigation strategies. This knowledge transforms volunteers into informed climate advocates.</p>

            <h3>Program Duration and Pricing</h3>
            <p>Programs range from 1-week introductions to 3-month intensive placements. All include accommodation in eco-lodges, locally sourced meals, training, equipment, and transportation. Longer programs offer opportunities to lead planting teams, manage nursery operations, and contribute to published research. Programs run year-round, with planting seasons varying by location.</p>

                <p>Swimming ability is not required for most mangrove restoration activities. Planting typically takes place in shallow tidal flats where water depth rarely exceeds knee height. However, some monitoring activities may involve boat-based surveys. If you are not a confident swimmer, let the program coordinators know and they will assign you to appropriate tasks. All participants are provided with life vests for any boat-based activities.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>All three locations welcome beginners with comprehensive training. Colombia's Cartagena coast program is ideal for first-timers due to its well-established infrastructure, calm planting conditions, and bilingual staff. Mexico's Sian Ka'an program offers the most diverse mangrove species and combines restoration with eco-tourism. Kenya's Mombasa coast program is best for those seeking immersive cultural exchange alongside conservation work.</p>
