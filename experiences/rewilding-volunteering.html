        <blockquote class="story-quote">
          "On my first day, the site was bare clay where cattle had grazed for decades. By my third month, the trees I planted in week one were knee-high, and birds were already nesting in the older plantings. A farmer who had been skeptical came by and said, 'The stream is running again.' That is the moment you understand what rewilding really means. It is not nostalgia for a lost wilderness. It is proof that nature wants to come back if we just get out of the way."

        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Habitat destruction is the leading cause of species extinction, with 75% of Earth's land surface significantly altered by human activity. Rewilding reverses this trajectory by restoring degraded land to functioning ecosystems. It is not simply tree planting: it is the reconstruction of entire ecological communities, from soil microbes to apex predators, through strategic interventions that catalyze natural regeneration. Our partner programs across four countries demonstrate that degraded pastures, abandoned farmland, and logged forests can recover to biodiverse ecosystems within 10-20 years with the right support.</p>

            <h3>Costa Rica: Cloud Forest Corridor</h3>
            <p>In the Monteverde-Arenal biological corridor, volunteers reconnect fragmented cloud forest patches by planting native trees on degraded cattle pasture. Over 120 tree species are used, sourced from the project's own nursery. The corridor project has already restored 8 kilometers of habitat, enabling quetzals, howler monkeys, and ocelots to move between forest fragments that were isolated for 40 years. Three-month volunteers can lead planting teams of 10.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Portugal: Mediterranean Rewilding</h3>
            <p>In the Alentejo region, volunteers restore landscapes scarred by eucalyptus monoculture and wildfire. Work involves replacing invasive eucalyptus with native cork oak, holm oak, and wild olive. The seed bank preserves genetics of rare Mediterranean plant species. Fire-resistant landscape design reduces future wildfire risk. Restored areas have seen the return of Iberian lynx, golden eagles, and wild boar within 5 years of intervention.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Kenya: Savanna Ecosystem Restoration</h3>
            <p>In the Laikipia Plateau, volunteers work alongside Maasai and Samburu communities to restore overgrazed rangeland. Activities include planting indigenous acacia woodland, removing invasive Opuntia cactus, creating wildlife crossing points across fenced areas, and monitoring wildlife populations using camera traps. The project has increased grass cover by 60% in restored zones, benefiting both pastoralist communities and wildlife including elephants, zebras, and wild dogs.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Colombia: Andean Cloud Forest Recovery</h3>
            <p>In the coffee region's cloud forests, volunteers restore habitat critical for over 200 bird species including the endangered gold-ringed tanager. Work involves planting native trees along stream corridors, creating shade-grown coffee buffer zones, and establishing biological monitoring plots. The seed bank preserves 400+ native cloud forest species. Restored areas sequester an estimated 15 tons of CO2 per hectare annually, contributing to Colombia's climate commitments.</p>

          <span class="section-label">Your Journey</span>
          <h2 id="activities-heading">What You Will Do as a Rewilding Volunteer</h2>
          <p>Core activities across all rewilding programs, adapted to local ecosystems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="philosophy-grid">
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>1. Native Tree Planting</h3>
            <p>The foundation of every rewilding program. You learn to identify native species, prepare planting sites, handle seedlings correctly, and plant using techniques that maximize survival rates. Each tree is GPS-tagged for long-term monitoring. In a typical week, a volunteer plants 150-200 trees across degraded land, building the skeleton of a future forest that will support hundreds of species for centuries.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>2. Invasive Species Removal</h3>
            <p>Invasive plants outcompete native species, reduce biodiversity, and alter fire regimes. You learn to identify invasive species in your program's ecosystem, use safe removal techniques (manual pulling, ring-barking, targeted cutting), and dispose of plant material to prevent regrowth. This unglamorous work is often the most impactful: removing a single invasive tree can free up resources for dozens of native seedlings.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>3. Wildlife Corridor Construction</h3>
            <p>Fragmented habitats are ecological death sentences for species that need large territories. You help design and plant wildlife corridors: strips of native vegetation connecting isolated habitat patches. This involves strategic planting, fence removal, stream buffer restoration, and coordination with local landowners. Corridor creation is one of the most cost-effective conservation interventions, often doubling species diversity within restored areas.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>4. Seed Collection and Banking</h3>
            <p>Every restoration project begins with seeds. You learn to identify seed-bearing native plants, collect seeds at the right maturity, clean and process seeds for storage, and maintain the seed bank's inventory. Seed banking preserves the genetic diversity of local plant populations, providing insurance against habitat loss and climate change. Longer-term volunteers help in the nursery, growing seedlings for future planting seasons.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>5. Wildlife Monitoring</h3>
            <p>Restoration success is measured by wildlife return. You set up and maintain camera traps, identify species from photos, conduct bird surveys using point-count methodology, track animal movements through footprint identification, and record data that demonstrates how restored habitats attract biodiversity. The thrill of finding a rare species on your camera trap, confirmed to be using a corridor you helped plant, is unmatched.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>6. Community Engagement</h3>
            <p>Rewilding succeeds only with community support. You participate in educational workshops at local schools, help establish community nurseries, join farmer training sessions on sustainable land management, and attend community celebrations of restoration milestones. These connections ensure that rewilding projects continue long after volunteers depart, sustained by communities that see direct benefits from restored ecosystems.</p>

                <p>Programs range from 1 week to 3 months. One-week programs provide an intensive introduction. Two-week programs allow deeper involvement. Monthly programs let you see measurable progress. Three-month programs offer leadership opportunities and the deepest ecological impact. Longer stays have proportionally greater impact and community integration.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>No special skills are required. All volunteers receive training in plant identification, planting techniques, and tool safety. Moderate physical fitness is recommended for 5-6 hours of outdoor work daily. Tasks can be adapted for different fitness levels with built-in rest breaks. Those with botanical or ecological backgrounds can take on specialized roles.</p>

                <p>In a typical one-week program, you plant 150-200 native trees, remove invasive plants from 500 square meters, and collect seeds from 20-30 species. Over three months, a volunteer plants 2,000+ trees and helps create 1-2 kilometers of wildlife corridor. All trees are GPS-tagged with 82% survival rates after three years.</p>
