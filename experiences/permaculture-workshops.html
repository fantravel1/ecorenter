        <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.6rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Permaculture is not a gardening technique. It is a way of seeing the world.</h2>
        <blockquote class="story-quote">
          "When you learn to observe how a forest grows itself, with no irrigation, no fertilizer, no weeding, you start to understand that nature already has the answers. Permaculture is simply learning to ask the right questions and then getting out of nature's way."
        </blockquote>
        <p class="story-attribution">&mdash; Wayan Suartika, Permaculture Teacher, Ubud</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Permaculture, a design system that mimics natural ecosystems to create abundant, self-sustaining food systems, has grown from a fringe idea into one of the most practical responses to industrial agriculture's environmental devastation. In our workshops, you do not just learn theory. You build compost systems, plant food forests, design water harvesting landscapes, and eat the food grown by previous workshop participants. The learning is circular, just like the systems you are studying.</p>

          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>The Setting</h3>
            <p>Nestled among Ubud's famous rice terraces, the Bali workshop campus is itself a living permaculture demonstration site. Over 200 edible species grow in layered food forests. Bamboo structures house classrooms, composting stations, and seed banks. The subak water temple irrigation system, a UNESCO-recognized traditional practice, feeds the surrounding rice paddies, demonstrating how indigenous water management predates modern permaculture by centuries.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Curriculum Highlights</h3>
            <p>Tropical food forest design with seven-layer planting systems. Hot composting, vermicomposting, and bokashi fermentation. Bamboo construction and natural building. Rice terrace ecology and the subak irrigation system. Tropical seed saving and heritage variety preservation. Aquaponics and integrated fish-plant systems. Natural pest management using companion planting and beneficial insects.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Instructors</h3>
            <p>Balinese permaculture teachers who combine traditional Tri Hita Karana philosophy (harmony with God, community, and nature) with modern permaculture design principles. Guest lectures from visiting international permaculture designers. All instruction is available in English and Indonesian.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Daily Rhythm</h3>
            <p>Mornings begin with hands-on garden work: planting, composting, harvesting. After a communal organic breakfast prepared from the garden, classroom sessions cover design theory. Afternoons return to practical application: building compost systems, designing water features, or grafting fruit trees. Evenings feature community meals and discussion circles under bamboo pavilions.</p>

          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Milpa Polyculture</h3>
            <p>Learn the milpa system, the 7,000-year-old Mesoamerican polyculture of corn, beans, and squash (the Three Sisters) that remains one of the most productive and sustainable farming systems ever developed. Understand how nitrogen-fixing beans feed the corn, how squash leaves shade the soil, and how this system produces complete nutrition without synthetic inputs.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Dryland Permaculture</h3>
            <p>Oaxaca's semi-arid climate demands water-wise design. Learn to build swales, berms, and rain gardens that capture and infiltrate every drop of rainfall. Study ancient Zapotec terracing techniques that prevent erosion on steep hillsides. Practice greywater recycling systems that turn kitchen water into garden irrigation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Seed Sovereignty</h3>
            <p>Mexico is the origin center of corn, with over 59 native varieties still cultivated by indigenous farmers. Workshop sessions on seed saving cover selection, drying, storage, and sharing. You learn why seed sovereignty is not just an agricultural issue but a cultural and political act of resistance against corporate seed monopolies.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Mezcal Agroforestry</h3>
            <p>Explore how sustainable mezcal production integrates with permaculture principles. Visit traditional palenques where agave is grown in polyculture with native trees, creating agroforestry systems that produce spirits, food, and timber while building soil and sequestering carbon.</p>
