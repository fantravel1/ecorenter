        <blockquote class="story-quote">
          "I started surfing to escape the world. Then I started finding bottle caps inside fish. Syringes in tide pools. Microplastics in the sand between my toes. The ocean that heals us is choking. Surf culture has an obligation to protect what gives us our greatest joy."

        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Eight million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean every year. That is one garbage truck per minute. While systemic change requires policy and industry transformation, direct cleanup removes immediate threats to marine life and coastal ecosystems. Our retreat programs combine the personal wellness benefits of surfing and yoga with the collective impact of organized ocean cleanup, proving that self-care and planet-care are not opposites but natural partners.</p>

            <h3>World Surfing Reserve</h3>
            <p>Ericeira is one of only a handful of World Surfing Reserves, recognized for exceptional wave quality and surf culture. But the same Atlantic currents that deliver perfect waves also carry debris from across Europe. The retreat is based in a solar-powered coastal house with ocean views, bike storage, and a zero-waste kitchen that sources from local organic farms and fisheries.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Cleanup Program</h3>
            <p>Three mornings per week are dedicated to organized cleanups. Teams cover different beach sections, rocky coastline areas, and harbor zones. You learn microplastic sieving techniques, marine debris classification (fishing gear, consumer packaging, industrial pellets), and data recording for the Ocean Conservancy's International Coastal Cleanup database. Collected data directly informs EU plastic pollution policy.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Sustainable Surfing</h3>
            <p>Surf sessions use boards made from recycled foam and bio-resin by local shapers. Wetsuits are either recycled neoprene or limestone-based alternatives. Reef-safe mineral sunscreen is mandatory. Transportation to surf spots is by bicycle or electric van. Instruction covers ocean safety, wave reading, and the ecology of the coastline you are surfing, building respect for the marine environment.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Yoga and Mindfulness</h3>
            <p>Daily yoga sessions on outdoor platforms overlooking the Atlantic integrate ocean-focused meditations with physical practice. Sunset sessions incorporate breathwork and gratitude practices connected to the ocean environment. Instructors trained in eco-psychology facilitate reflections on the relationship between personal wellbeing and planetary health.</p>

        <div class="philosophy-grid">
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>The Plastic Challenge</h3>
            <p>Bali receives an estimated 33,000 tonnes of plastic waste per year, much of it carried by rivers from inland communities lacking waste management infrastructure. During rainy season, Canggu's beaches can be carpeted with plastic. The Bali retreat addresses this crisis directly, combining massive beach cleanup operations with river interception projects that prevent plastic from reaching the ocean in the first place.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>River Interception</h3>
            <p>Beyond beach cleanup, the Bali program includes river trash trap maintenance and community waste management education in upstream villages. You help install and maintain simple but effective river barriers that capture floating waste before it reaches the sea, and participate in village workshops on composting, waste separation, and plastic alternative adoption.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Balinese Yoga Tradition</h3>
            <p>Yoga in Bali connects to a living spiritual tradition. Sessions incorporate Balinese meditation techniques, temple ceremony participation (with community invitation), and philosophical discussions on the Balinese concept of Tri Hita Karana: harmony between humans, nature, and the divine. This framework naturally aligns with the retreat's conservation mission.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Sustainable Surf Culture</h3>
            <p>Bali's surf scene is growing rapidly, and with it, its environmental impact. The retreat partners with local board makers who craft surfboards from reclaimed wood and bio-resin. Beach-side waste audit workshops teach surfers to identify and reduce their personal plastic footprint. The goal is to seed a surf culture that protects the waves it rides.</p>
