        <span class="section-label">The Costa Rica Story</span>
        <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.6rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">In 1987, Costa Rica had lost over 79% of its forests. Then something extraordinary happened.</h2>
        <blockquote class="story-quote">
          "The country made a radical choice: pay people to grow forests instead of cutting them down. The Payment for Environmental Services program did not just stop deforestation - it reversed it. Today, over 52% of Costa Rica is forested again. That is not marketing. That is a measurable miracle."
        </blockquote>
        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Costa Rica abolished its army in 1948 and redirected military spending to education, healthcare, and environmental protection. That single decision seeded the sustainability culture that defines the country today. When Costa Ricans say "Pura Vida" - the pure life - they are not just being friendly. They are expressing a worldview where human wellbeing and ecological health are inseparable. Every eco-resort in our database exists within this national framework of environmental consciousness.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">The result? A country smaller than West Virginia that contains 5% of the world's biodiversity. A nation where monkeys swing through forest canopies that almost disappeared. Where quetzals flash emerald across cloud forests that conservation saved. Where sea turtles nest on beaches protected by communities that once harvested their eggs. Costa Rica proves that environmental destruction is a choice - and so is recovery.</p>

Jaguars, scarlet macaws, four species of monkey, and all four Costa Rican sea turtle species call it home.

          <h2 id="practices-heading">Sustainability Practices Across Costa Rica Eco-Resorts</h2>
          <p>What verified eco-resorts in Costa Rica are actually doing - documented with evidence, not marketing brochures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="philosophy-grid">
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Renewable Energy Leadership</h3>
            <p>Costa Rica's national grid runs on 98% renewable energy, giving eco-resorts an inherent advantage. Many go further: on-site solar arrays, micro-hydro turbines on mountain streams, and biogas digesters converting organic waste to cooking fuel. Average renewable energy use among our verified listings is 94%.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Reforestation Programs</h3>
            <p>Over 60% of listed eco-resorts maintain active reforestation programs. Lapa Rios protects 1,000 acres of private rainforest. Finca Rosa Blanca has planted over 30,000 native trees. Many resorts participate in the national PES program, earning payments for maintaining forest carbon sinks.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Water Conservation</h3>
            <p>Rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling, and natural filtration systems are standard among top-tier listings. Cloud forest resorts use fog-catching nets for supplemental water supply. Coastal properties implement desalination alternatives using passive solar distillation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Community Integration</h3>
            <p>Average local employment rate across verified resorts is 87%. Many operate community development funds, sourcing food from local organic farms, supporting rural schools, and hiring indigenous guides. The benefits of tourism flow directly into the communities that host it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Wildlife Corridors</h3>
            <p>Fragmented habitat is the silent killer of biodiversity. Costa Rica's eco-resorts increasingly serve as biological bridges, maintaining forested corridors between national parks. These corridors allow jaguars, tapirs, and other wide-ranging species to move between protected areas.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Zero Waste Progress</h3>
            <p>Composting, on-site recycling, plastic elimination, and food waste reduction programs are prevalent. Leading resorts achieve 85-95% waste diversion rates. Several operate biochar programs that convert agricultural waste into soil amendment, sequestering carbon while improving local farmland.</p>

          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Dry Season (Dec-Apr)</h3>
            <p>Most predictable weather, peak tourist season. Higher prices and more crowded. Pacific coast is sunniest. Best for beach-focused eco-resorts and surfing. Book well in advance for top-rated eco-lodges.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Green Season (May-Nov)</h3>
            <p>Lower prices, fewer crowds, lush landscapes. Morning sun with afternoon showers typical. Best wildlife viewing as animals are more active. Whale watching on Osa Peninsula peaks September-October. The most sustainable choice for reducing overtourism impact.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Shoulder Months (May, Nov)</h3>
            <p>The sweet spot. Transition months offer good weather, moderate prices, and lower environmental impact from tourist volumes. Many eco-resorts offer special green season rates with added sustainability experiences.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Internet &amp; Co-Working</h3>
            <p>Fiber internet (50-300 Mbps) in San Jose, Santa Teresa, Tamarindo, and Nosara. Established co-working spaces in major nomad hubs. Remote eco-lodges typically offer 10-50 Mbps via cellular or satellite. Starlink expanding rapidly to jungle locations.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Digital Nomad Visa</h3>
            <p>Costa Rica offers a Digital Nomad Visa (Rentista) allowing stays up to one year with foreign income tax exemption. Minimum income requirement of $3,000/month or $5,000 for families. Renewable for a second year. Access to national healthcare system included.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Sustainable Transit</h3>
            <p>Domestic flights are short but carbon-intensive. Public buses reach most destinations affordably. Shared shuttles between tourist areas reduce per-person emissions. Electric vehicle rental is expanding. Many eco-resorts offer complimentary bike access and nature trail networks.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Costa Rica dedicates 25% of its national territory to protected areas - one of the highest percentages worldwide. The country generates 98% of its electricity from renewable sources including hydroelectric, geothermal, wind, and solar. Its Payment for Environmental Services program, launched in 1997, directly pays landowners to conserve forests. Costa Rica doubled its forest cover from 21% in 1987 to over 52% today, making it the only tropical country to have reversed deforestation at a national scale. This national commitment creates the foundation for genuinely sustainable tourism at every level.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" role="region">
              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>The dry season (December to April) offers the most predictable weather, but the green season (May to November) provides lower prices, fewer crowds, lush landscapes, and better wildlife viewing as many species are more active. For the Osa Peninsula, September and October offer exceptional whale watching. Monteverde's cloud forest is misty year-round, which is essential for its unique ecosystem. The shoulder months of May and November often provide the best balance of weather, price, and sustainability through lower tourist impact on fragile ecosystems.</p>

                <p>Costa Rica has Central America's best internet infrastructure. Major towns and tourist areas offer fiber connections with 50-300 Mbps speeds.

                <p>The Nicoya Peninsula is one of only five Blue Zones worldwide - regions where people live measurably longer, healthier lives. Residents regularly live past 100 years. The Blue Zone lifestyle centers on plant-rich diet from local organic farms, daily physical activity, strong community bonds, and deep connection to the natural environment. Several eco-resorts in Nicoya integrate Blue Zone principles into their guest experiences, offering farm-to-table dining, community engagement programs, and nature-based wellness activities that embody the "Pura Vida" philosophy.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Costa Rica has both genuine sustainability leaders and greenwashers. EcoRenter verifies each listing individually using our four-tier evidence system. The country's Certification for Sustainable Tourism program provides a baseline but varies in rigor. Our Tier A listings hold independent third-party certifications and audited sustainability data. We document trade-offs transparently: a resort may excel in renewable energy but underperform in waste management. Always check the evidence tier and impact scores on individual resort pages for the full picture.</p>
