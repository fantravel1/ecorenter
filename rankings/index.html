    <section class="story-block" aria-labelledby="method-story">

        <span class="section-label">Our Approach</span>
        <h2 id="method-story" style="font-size:1.6rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Rankings should reflect reality, not marketing budgets.</h2>
        <blockquote class="story-quote">
          "Most eco-resort rankings are paid placements or certification lists. Ours is neither. We score every resort across five sustainability dimensions using verified evidence, then rank them by their actual impact, not their advertising spend."
        </blockquote>
        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">The travel industry's ranking systems are broken. Magazines rank resorts based on advertising relationships. Booking platforms rank based on commission rates. Certification bodies rank based on membership fees. EcoRenter ranks based on one thing only: verified sustainability impact. Our methodology is published, our data sources are documented, and our editorial team cannot be influenced by resort operators.</p>

    <!-- Methodology Explained -->
    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="methodology-heading">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="section-header">
          <span class="section-label">Full Transparency</span>
          <h2 id="methodology-heading">Our Ranking Methodology</h2>
          <p>Every score in our rankings is derived from this transparent, reproducible methodology.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="philosophy-grid">
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Dimension 1: Energy (20%)</h3>
            <p>Percentage of renewable energy use, energy efficiency measures, carbon intensity per guest night, and grid independence. Scored 0-100 based on documented energy data. Solar, wind, micro-hydro, and biogas systems receive higher scores than grid-dependent operations.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Dimension 2: Water (20%)</h3>
            <p>Water consumption per guest night, conservation measures, greywater recycling, rainwater harvesting, and wastewater treatment quality. Resorts in water-stressed regions receive adjusted baselines to account for regional water availability.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Dimension 3: Waste (20%)</h3>
            <p>Waste diversion rate, composting programs, single-use plastic elimination, zero-waste progress, and circular economy practices. Measured in kilograms of waste per guest night with higher scores for lower waste generation and higher diversion rates.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Dimension 4: Community (20%)</h3>
            <p>Local employment percentage, wage fairness (compared to regional averages), community benefit programs, cultural respect practices, and supply chain localization. This dimension ensures that environmental sustainability does not come at the expense of social justice.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Dimension 5: Biodiversity (20%)</h3>
            <p>Habitat protection, wildlife corridor maintenance, species monitoring programs, reforestation or restoration projects, and invasive species management. Scored based on documented conservation outcomes, not just policies.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Evidence Tier Multiplier</h3>
            <p>The evidence tier acts as a confidence multiplier: Tier A (1.0x) for independently verified data, Tier B (0.85x) for self-reported but documented data, Tier C (0.7x) for community-verified data. This ensures that resorts with stronger evidence backing rank appropriately higher.</p>

            <p>Every ranked resort includes documented trade-offs: areas where they excel and areas where they fall short. No resort is perfect, and our rankings reflect this nuance rather than hiding it.</p>
