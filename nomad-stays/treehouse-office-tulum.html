        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Set in 3 hectares of protected Yucatan jungle on the inland side of Tulum's hotel zone, the Treehouse Office is a network of elevated wooden platforms built around living ramon and ceiba trees. The structures use steel ring brackets that accommodate tree growth without piercing bark. Walkways connect four main work platforms at 6-8 meters elevation, each with 6-8 dedicated desks, power, and WiFi. The ground level houses an enclosed air-conditioned workspace, the organic restaurant, and a natural cenote swimming pool fed by underground rivers. A 22kW solar array hidden beneath the canopy provides the majority of electricity, and 800 native trees have been planted to restore previously cleared areas of the property.</p>

            <h3>Canopy Platforms</h3>
            <p>Four elevated treehouse platforms sit at 6-8 meters above the jungle floor. Each platform hosts 6-8 dedicated desks with ergonomic chairs, monitor arms, and USB-C charging. Ceiling fans provide airflow. Mesh screens keep insects out while maintaining open-air views. The platforms are connected by timber walkways with rope railings and are fully accessible via a central staircase.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Internet Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>Primary connection: 120Mbps fiber from Telmex, a significant achievement in Tulum's jungle zone. Backup: Starlink satellite with automatic failover at 70Mbps. Directional WiFi 6 antennas beam signal to each platform. Ethernet at all dedicated desks. The network team monitors connectivity daily. Speed tests posted weekly on the community board.</p>

          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Ground-Level Studio</h3>
            <p>An enclosed, air-conditioned ground-level studio provides a climate-controlled alternative. 12 desks with full ergonomic setup. Sound-insulated phone booths. A 6-person meeting room with video conferencing. Floor-to-ceiling windows face the cenote pool. This is the preferred workspace during rainy season or peak afternoon heat.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Power & Backup</h3>
            <p>22kW solar array distributed beneath the jungle canopy generates 70% of electricity. 20kWh battery bank smooths solar intermittency. Diesel generator backup for extended cloudy periods. All platforms and ground studio have surge-protected power. UPS systems protect networking equipment. The solar array's forest-floor placement preserves the canopy aesthetic.</p>

The treehouse structures are built around 15 living trees using non-invasive bracket systems. Wildlife cameras document spider monkeys, coatis, iguanas, and 120+ bird species on the property. No trees were removed during construction.</p>
