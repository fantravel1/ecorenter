          "text": "Lake Kivu contains massive reserves of dissolved methane -- a geological hazard that Rwanda has turned into an energy source. The KivuWatt project extracts methane from the lake's deep waters and generates electricity, which feeds into Rwanda's national grid. The workspace in Gisenyi draws power from this grid, meaning a portion of its electricity comes from the lake visible through its windows. While not 100% methane-powered (the grid mixes sources), the workspace benefits from one of Africa's most innovative renewable energy projects."

          "text": "The workspace is located near Gisenyi's traditional fishing beaches where wooden pirogues (canoes) launch at dawn and return with the day's catch. The co-work organizes morning visits to the fish landing sites where nomads can watch the catch come in, buy fresh isambaza (sardines) and tilapia directly from fishers at fair prices, and learn about Lake Kivu's fishing culture. Some members join dawn fishing expeditions on rest days. The workspace sources its kitchen fish directly from these fishers, creating economic connection between nomads and the fishing community."

From the workspace, Mount Nyiragongo (3,470m, Democratic Republic of Congo) is visible across the lake border -- one of the world's most active volcanoes with a permanent lava lake in its summit crater. On clear days, the volcanic peaks of Nyamulagira and the broader Virunga chain are visible. The workspace terrace offers unobstructed views of these volcanoes across the lake, creating what may be the world's most dramatic coworking backdrop."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "60Mbps is sufficient for most remote work tasks including video conferencing, cloud-based applications, and standard file transfers. The workspace uses a dedicated MTN business fiber line with 4G backup. Latency is higher than European or North American connections but adequate for most work. For bandwidth-intensive tasks like large file uploads or simultaneous video streams, the connection may feel slower than urban Western workspaces. The workspace is honest about this limitation -- Gisenyi is a small lakeside town, not a tech metropolis."

At $280/month, this is among the most affordable nomad workspaces in the EcoRenter database. Accommodation in Gisenyi is available from $200-400/month separately."

        <p class="story-attribution">&mdash; Co-work founder, Gisenyi</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Gisenyi is a lakeside town on Rwanda's western border, where Lake Kivu meets the Virunga volcanoes and the DRC border. It is quieter, cheaper, and more authentically local than Kigali. For nomads seeking genuine cultural immersion alongside productive work, Lake Kivu Co-Work offers what no urban workspace can: a desk where the view includes an active volcano, traditional fishing boats, and the lake that generates some of your electricity. The pace is slower. The cost is lower. The experience is richer.</p>
