Average speeds are 92Mbps download and 85Mbps upload with 14ms latency. A 4G Telkomsel backup activates automatically. WiFi 6 covers all workspace areas and private rooms. Ethernet at dedicated desks. Sidemen has received fiber optic infrastructure recently, making it viable for remote work despite its rural setting. Uptime exceeded 99.2% last quarter."}},

Optional extras: Balinese cooking classes, silver jewelry making workshops, guided Mount Agung treks, and temple ceremony participation with local families."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What makes Sidemen different from Ubud or Canggu for nomads?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Sidemen offers what Ubud had 15 years ago: authentic village life without mass tourism. The Sidemen valley is one of Bali's most scenic with dramatic rice terraces backed by Mount Agung. Prices are 40-60% lower than Ubud or Canggu. The community is small (usually 8-12 nomads) creating deep connections rather than surface networking. Daily life includes real interactions with Balinese families rather than tourist-oriented businesses. The trade-off is fewer restaurants and nightlife, which most residents consider a benefit for focused work."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the traditional Balinese compound like?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A traditional Balinese compound follows specific architectural principles based on Hindu cosmology. Buildings surround a central courtyard with a family temple. The retreat has adapted this layout: the main house serves as the co-working space, individual pavilions house private rooms, the former granary is the yoga studio, and the central courtyard hosts communal meals and evening gatherings. Original stone carvings, thatched roofs, and offering platforms are preserved. The compound belongs to a Balinese family who live in the adjacent traditional compound."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What yoga and wellness offerings are available?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Daily morning yoga at 7am in the open-air studio overlooking rice terraces. Styles rotate between Hatha, Vinyasa, and Yin depending on the instructor. A meditation garden with a lotus pond offers quiet contemplation space. Weekly Balinese sound healing sessions with traditional gamelan instruments. Monthly purification ceremonies at local water temples (optional). The yoga studio is available for personal practice throughout the day. Teacher training intensives are offered quarterly for longer-stay residents."}}

        <p class="story-attribution">&mdash; Sophie, Freelance Writer, 6-month resident</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">The Sidemen valley in East Bali is what many travelers imagine when they dream of Bali: terraced rice paddies descending steep hillsides, the volcanic cone of Mount Agung rising above, and village life centered on temples, ceremonies, and the ancient subak irrigation system. The Rice Terrace Retreat occupies a traditional compound belonging to a Balinese family who converted it for nomad residents while preserving its cultural authenticity. The result is a co-living space that immerses you in genuine Balinese village life rather than the tourist bubble of southern Bali.</p>
