        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Located in a renovated 19th-century building in Lisbon's Intendente neighborhood, the Eco Co-Living combines the architectural character of old Lisbon with modern sustainable infrastructure. A 15kW rooftop solar array generates 70% of the building's electricity. Reclaimed wood furniture fills the co-working spaces. A communal kitchen sources 80% of ingredients from organic farms within 50 kilometers. It is a living demonstration that comfortable, productive co-living does not require ecological compromise.</p>
