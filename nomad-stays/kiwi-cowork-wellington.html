Wellington's municipal electricity retailers offer 100% certified renewable plans, and Kiwi Co-Work operates on such a plan. Every device you charge, every light you switch on, is powered by water, wind, or geothermal energy. This is verified through New Zealand's Electricity Authority data and renewable energy certificates."

The Town Belt offers 425 hectares of green space with native bush walking tracks. The Skyline Walkway provides ridgeline trails with harbor and coast views through regenerating native forest.

        <p class="story-attribution">&mdash; Local tech community organizer, Wellington</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Wellington is compact, walkable, and surrounded by nature. Native bush reserves with kiwi birds sit minutes from the CBD. The harbor frames every commute. Wind turbines spin on the surrounding hills. And the city's creative community -- filmmakers, game developers, designers, entrepreneurs -- is accessible and welcoming in the way that only small capitals can be. Kiwi Co-Work places you at the intersection of all of this: fast internet, renewable power, great coffee, and a community that makes remote work feel connected.</p>

            <h3>Summer (Dec-Feb): 9/10</h3>
            <p>Long days, warm weather (18-24C), outdoor dining, harbor swimming. Wellington on a good day is one of the world's best cities. Cafe culture moves outdoors. Bush walks are stunning.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Autumn (Mar-May): 8/10</h3>
            <p>Mild temperatures, spectacular autumn colors in the botanical gardens. Fewer tourists. Film festival season. The workspace is at its most productive with comfortable indoor weather.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Winter (Jun-Aug): 6/10</h3>
            <p>Cool and windy (8-12C) but never freezing. Indoor culture thrives -- live music, theater, cafes. The wind is infamous but part of the character. Great for focused work periods.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Spring (Sep-Nov): 8/10</h3>
            <p>Improving weather, native birds nesting, bush walks at their greenest. Wildly variable weather keeps things interesting. Arts and music festival season begins.</p>
