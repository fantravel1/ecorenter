          "Chiang Mai has the best nomad infrastructure in Asia, and Mountain Hub is the best of it. The internet is faster than my office in Berlin.

        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Mountain Hub sits on the western edge of Chiang Mai city, where the urban grid gives way to the forested slopes of Doi Suthep-Pui National Park. The workspace occupies a converted teak compound surrounded by a permaculture garden that produces herbs, vegetables, and tropical fruits. The main work hall is a restored northern Thai wooden building with soaring ceilings, teak floors, and walls of windows looking out at the mountain. A garden pavilion provides an open-air alternative. Private and shared bungalows are scattered among fruit trees, each with covered terraces for evening work. The organic cafe serves northern Thai specialties using garden produce and hill tribe coffee, with the Sunday organic market held on the property grounds attracting both nomads and locals.</p>

            <h3>Cool Season (Nov-Feb): 10/10</h3>
            <p>Chiang Mai at its finest. Daytime 22-30C, nights cool to 12-18C. Clear mountain air. Temple festivals, the famous Yi Peng lantern festival (November), and vibrant night markets. Peak nomad season with the largest community. Comfortable outdoor work. Book early.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Hot Season (Mar-May): 6/10</h3>
            <p>Hot (32-40C) and the burning season creates poor air quality in March-April from agricultural fires in surrounding mountains. HEPA purifiers essential. Songkran (April water festival) is unmissable. The workspace AC and air purification keep the indoor environment comfortable. Fewer nomads, lower prices.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Early Rainy (Jun-Aug): 8/10</h3>
            <p>Afternoon rain showers clear the air. Temperatures drop to 25-32C. The mountains turn brilliant green. Doi Suthep waterfalls are spectacular. Smaller but dedicated nomad community. Good availability. The garden is at its most productive and beautiful.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Late Rainy (Sep-Oct): 8/10</h3>
            <p>Wettest months but mornings are usually sunny. Lush, dramatic landscapes. Loi Krathong (late October/early November) is magical. Excellent value for accommodation. The community is intimate and close-knit. The transition to cool season begins in late October with cooler evenings.</p>
