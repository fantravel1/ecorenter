        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">The Bamboo Co-Work sits on the edge of Canggu's last remaining rice terraces, a five-minute walk from Echo Beach's renowned surf break. The entire structure is built from giant Dendrocalamus asper bamboo, harvested sustainably from managed groves in East Java. A soaring open-air main hall seats 30 nomads at individual desks, while enclosed bamboo pods provide air-conditioned focus rooms. The organic cafe serves single-origin Kintamani coffee and plant-based meals sourced from farms in Tabanan and Karangasem. A 20kW solar array on the canopy roof generates the majority of the electricity, and rainwater harvesting irrigates the surrounding permaculture garden.</p>

            <h3>Dry Season (Apr-Jun): 9/10</h3>
            <p>Perfect conditions: sunny days, low humidity, consistent surf. Temperatures 26-30C. Rice terraces are vivid green. Tourist season begins but Canggu absorbs crowds well. Ideal arrival window for new residents. Galungan and Kuningan festivals may fall in this period.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Peak Dry (Jul-Sep): 8/10</h3>
            <p>Best weather but peak tourist season. Temperatures 25-29C. Surf is excellent. Cafes and beaches are busy. Book accommodation early. Nyepi (Day of Silence) preparations visible across Bali. The co-working space is at capacity; dedicated desks recommended over hot desks.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Transition (Oct-Nov): 8/10</h3>
            <p>Crowds thin as occasional afternoon rains begin. Temperatures 27-32C. Surf remains good. Prices drop. The rice terraces are harvested and replanted. A sweet spot of good weather, lower costs, and relaxed atmosphere. The retractable rain screens come into regular use.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Wet Season (Dec-Mar): 7/10</h3>
            <p>Daily tropical downpours, usually 1-3 hours in the afternoon. Temperatures 27-33C with higher humidity. Surf is inconsistent but fun. Lowest prices and fewest tourists. The landscape is lush and dramatic. Focus pods with air conditioning become more popular. Many long-term nomads prefer this quieter season.</p>
