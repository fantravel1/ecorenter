          "I tried half a dozen co-working spaces in Playa before landing here. The difference is the building itself: solar panels on the roof, reclaimed wood everywhere, an organic cafe that actually knows what it is doing, and internet that never fails during client calls.

        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Located in a quiet residential block between Quinta Avenida and the beach, the Eco Hub occupies a purpose-built four-story building designed from the ground up for sustainable co-living. The rooftop combines a solar array, infinity pool, and shaded co-working terrace with Caribbean Sea views. The ground floor houses an organic cafe and the main co-working hall. Studios on floors two and three provide private living spaces. Reclaimed tropical hardwoods from demolished structures in Merida furnish every room. A constructed wetland in the courtyard filters greywater for the rooftop garden, which supplies herbs and greens to the cafe kitchen.</p>
