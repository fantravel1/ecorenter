The cost of living is remarkably low: a full meal costs $2-4, coffee is $0.50-1, and a private room at the coliving is just $450/month. The nomad community is tiny (5-10 people) and tight-knit."

Some nomads fly into Medellin, spend a few days in the city, then base themselves in Jardin for longer periods, returning to Medellin for flights or city amenities. The town has a hospital, pharmacies, banks with ATMs, and a small supermarket. The coliving provides transport coordination and welcomes new arrivals with a town orientation walk."

        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Jardin (meaning "garden" in Spanish) is a perfectly preserved Antioqueno pueblo of 14,000 people nestled at 1,750 meters in the western Andes. No international chain stores. No tourist buses. Just painted colonial buildings, a central plaza where farmers drink tinto and play dominoes, and surrounding cloud forests that host some of the richest birdlife on the continent. The Cloud Forest Coliving is a renovated eco-house on the town's edge, where the garden merges with coffee fields and the cloud forest rises above. It proves that the world's most beautiful office can also be the most affordable.</p>

            <h3>Veranda Workspace</h3>
            <p>The house's covered veranda wraps around two sides, providing the main workspace with panoramic views across the Jardin valley. 8 dedicated desks with comfortable chairs, power strips, and USB charging. The veranda is weather-protected by the deep eaves typical of Antioqueno architecture. Mountain breezes keep temperatures comfortable year-round without fans or air conditioning.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Indoor Study</h3>
            <p>A quiet room with 4 dedicated desks for focused work and video calls. Original tile floors, whitewashed walls, and high ceilings. The only air-conditioned space, though Jardin's climate rarely requires it. Bookshelves hold literature on Colombian culture, cloud forest ecology, and coffee production. A small meeting area with whiteboard seats 6.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Private Rooms</h3>
            <p>Eight private rooms with mountain or garden views. Handmade wooden furniture, comfortable beds, warm blankets for cool Andean nights, and private balconies or garden access. Shared bathrooms with solar-heated water. The house is built from local wood and adobe with traditional Antioqueno architectural details preserved throughout.</p>

          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Experiences</h3>
            <p>Weekly coffee farm visits with cupping sessions. Guided birdwatching walks to the Andean cock-of-the-rock reserve. Monthly hot springs excursions. Cloud forest hikes through orchid-laden trails. Caving trips to the Cueva del Esplendor waterfall cave. Trout fishing in mountain streams. Plaza evenings with locals. Each experience connects you to the landscape and community that make Jardin extraordinary.</p>

            <p>Solar water heating provides 80% of hot water. Colombia's grid is 70% hydroelectric, making even grid electricity largely renewable. The house was renovated using traditional adobe and local wood construction techniques with modern insulation. LED lighting throughout. Natural ventilation eliminates the need for air conditioning at 1,750 meters elevation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Food and Community</h3>
            <p>96% of food sourced within 20 kilometers: coffee from neighboring fincas, vegetables from the Jardin market, trout from local streams, fruit from the garden. All 6 staff are Jardin residents paid above local wages. 4% of revenue supports the town's cloud forest conservation trust. The coliving participates in annual community tree planting days, adding 200 native trees annually to degraded cloud forest margins.</p>
