The low season (May-October) brings afternoon rain and rougher seas but lower prices, fewer tourists, and a tight-knit nomad community. The workspace is comfortable year-round."

        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Koh Lanta is a long, narrow island in the Andaman Sea, south of Krabi, that has managed to resist the overdevelopment that consumed nearby Koh Phi Phi. The Jungle Co-Work sits on the western coast where long sandy beaches face spectacular sunsets. The workspace occupies a series of bamboo-and-timber pavilions built among tropical trees just back from the beach. The main work hall is open-air with retractable screens for the occasional rain shower, offering views of the sea through coconut palms. Private bamboo bungalows are scattered through the tropical garden, each with a porch and hammock. The organic cafe serves Thai and international dishes using ingredients from the on-site garden and local fishing boats.</p>

            <h3>Beachfront Work Hall</h3>
            <p>The main bamboo pavilion seats 20 nomads at individual teak desks with ergonomic chairs, monitor risers, and power strips. Open sides face the sea through coconut palms. Ceiling fans and sea breeze provide natural cooling. Retractable bamboo screens for weather protection. The sound of waves provides a natural ambient soundtrack for focused work.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Internet Infrastructure</h3>

            <h3>Beach Terrace Workspace</h3>
            <p>A shaded teak deck extends toward the beach with 8 weatherproof workstations. Ideal for morning work sessions before the midday heat. Full WiFi coverage. Power outlets at each station. Laptop-friendly shade canopies. This is where most nomads gravitate for creative and casual work, reserving the main hall for calls and deep focus.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Power & Backup</h3>
            <p>15kW solar array generates 60% of electricity. Remaining power from Koh Lanta's grid. 10kWh battery backup handles brief outages. All desks have surge-protected power strips. UPS protects networking equipment. Island power is generally reliable, with rare interruptions quickly covered by the battery system.</p>

          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Low Season (Jul-Aug): 7/10</h3>
            <p>Regular afternoon storms but mornings are usually clear for work. Rougher seas limit diving to calmer sites. Dramatic cloud formations and double rainbows. Very few tourists. Best prices. The nomad community is small but dedicated -- the real island lifers.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Late Rainy (Sep-Oct): 7/10</h3>
            <p>Wettest months. Mornings generally dry. Some dive shops close. The island empties. Walking the beach alone at sunset becomes routine. Excellent value. Strong sense of community among those who stay. The transition back to high season begins in late October.</p>
