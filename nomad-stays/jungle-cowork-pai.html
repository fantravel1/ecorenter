        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Nestled in the Pai Valley, surrounded by limestone mountains in Mae Hong Son province, the Jungle Co-Work sits on the banks of the Pai River, a five-minute scooter ride from the famous Pai Walking Street. The workspace occupies a series of bamboo-and-timber pavilions connected by garden paths. The main work hall overlooks the river through open sides shaded by mango and jackfruit trees. Private bamboo bungalows are scattered through the garden, each with its own terrace and hammock. The organic kitchen serves traditional northern Thai cuisine prepared by local cooks using ingredients from the property garden and hill tribe coffee cooperatives in the surrounding mountains.</p>

            <p>Pai at its finest. Daytime 20-28C, nights cool to 10-15C. Misty mornings on the river. Crystal clear skies. Pai Canyon sunset hikes. Hot springs feel essential. The walking street night market is vibrant. Peak nomad season. Book early.</p>

            <h3>Hot Season (Mar-May): 7/10</h3>
            <p>Hot (30-38C). Burning season brings haze to northern Thailand in March-April. Waterfalls and hot springs provide relief. The workspace fans work overtime. Fewer tourists. Songkran (Thai New Year water festival in April) is unforgettable. Best prices for accommodation.</p>

            <h3>Early Rainy (Jun-Aug): 8/10</h3>
            <p>Afternoon thunderstorms refresh the valley. Temperatures drop to 24-30C. The landscape turns emerald green. Waterfalls are at their most powerful. Rice planting creates beautiful paddy landscapes. Fewer tourists. The covered riverside workspace handles rain beautifully.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Late Rainy (Sep-Oct): 8/10</h3>
            <p>Wettest months but mornings are usually clear. Lush, dramatic landscapes. River levels rise. Some roads may be temporarily impassable. The community is small and tight-knit. Excellent value. The transition to cool season begins in late October with spectacular sunsets.</p>
