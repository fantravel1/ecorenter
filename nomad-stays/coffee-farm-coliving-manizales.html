The cost of living is among the lowest in Colombia's major cities. The city has excellent healthcare, a lively cultural scene, and is the gateway to Los Nevados National Park with its snow-capped volcanoes. Manizales is less touristic than Medellin or Bogota, offering authentic Colombian life. The growing digital nomad community remains small and tight-knit."

        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Set at 1,600 meters on the western slope of the Andes, 20 minutes from Manizales, the Coffee Farm Coliving occupies a working 15-acre finca producing shade-grown, Rainforest Alliance certified arabica coffee. The colonial-era farmhouse has been thoughtfully converted: original tile floors and wooden balconies preserved, modern workspace added in the former coffee drying building, and 100Mbps fiber internet installed. The farm employs 8 full-time workers year-round and produces 2,000 kilos of green coffee annually under a canopy of native shade trees that host 120 bird species.</p>

            <h3>Drying House Workspace</h3>
            <p>The former coffee drying building has been converted into the main workspace: 10 dedicated desks with ergonomic chairs, monitor stands, and power strips. Original wooden drying racks have been repurposed as shelving. Skylights provide natural illumination. The space smells faintly of coffee year-round. Two phone booths for private calls.</p>

          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Veranda Co-Working</h3>
            <p>The farmhouse's wrap-around veranda offers open-air workspaces with views across the Andes to the snowcapped Nevado del Ruiz volcano. Power outlets, WiFi coverage, and hammock seating. Morning mist burns off by 9am to reveal crystalline mountain panoramas. The best seats in the house.</p>

            <h3>Coffee Lab</h3>
            <p>A dedicated cupping room with SCA-standard equipment: cupping bowls, grinders, roast sample machines, and a flavor wheel. Weekly cupping sessions led by the farm's Q-grader trained owner teach residents to evaluate coffee like professionals. During harvest season, you can cup the lots you helped pick that morning.</p>

            <h3>Farm Experiences</h3>
            <p>Dawn picking sessions (6-11am), pulping and fermentation tours, drying patio management, and roasting workshops. The farm also maintains an organic vegetable garden, fruit orchards, and a medicinal herb collection. Guided birdwatching walks identify 120 species in the shade canopy. Hikes to nearby hot springs and waterfalls.</p>
