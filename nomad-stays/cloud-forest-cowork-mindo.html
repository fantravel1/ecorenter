Dry season (June-September) offers clearer mornings and lighter rainfall. Wet season (December-April) brings heavier afternoon rain but mornings are usually clear. The covered workspace is usable in all weather. Humidity is moderate -- lower than coastal tropics but higher than highland cities. The consistent temperatures eliminate the need for air conditioning or heating. Most nomads find June through September the most comfortable working months."

        <div class="story-content">
          <h3 style="font-size:1.2rem;">Chocolate Farm Tours</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Mindo is surrounded by artisanal chocolate farms where cacao is grown, fermented, roasted, and processed into bars. Weekend tours with partner farms show the complete bean-to-bar process. You taste cacao at every stage and make your own bar to take home. These are working agricultural operations producing chocolate sold locally and internationally -- not tourist attractions. A perfect afternoon break from screen time.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Orchid Gardens</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The on-site garden holds over 200 orchid species, many found only in the Choco cloud forest. Walking the garden paths between work sessions provides a reset that no coffee break can match. The diversity of forms -- from microscopic blooms to dinner-plate-sized flowers -- demonstrates the evolutionary creativity that makes this ecosystem globally significant. Staff maintain species identification labels for self-guided exploration.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Waterfall Hikes</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Mindo's river valley contains over 20 waterfalls accessible by hiking trails ranging from easy strolls to challenging scrambles. One guided waterfall hike per week is included in the monthly rate. Additional hikes can be arranged with local guides. The Nambillo River trail passes seven waterfalls in a single three-hour loop. Natural swimming pools at waterfall bases provide refreshment during warm-season hikes. All trails are within 30 minutes of the workspace.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Hummingbird Photography</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">With 15-20 species visiting the workspace feeders, Mindo is a photographer's paradise. Early morning and late afternoon light creates ideal conditions. The resident Green-crowned Brilliant, Violet-tailed Sylph, and Booted Racket-tail are particularly photogenic. No telephoto lens needed -- feeders are positioned within three meters of seating areas. Several nomads have built successful photography side projects from their Mindo stay.</p>
