          "I worked from the terrace every single day for two months. The Algarve sun powers the building and your motivation.

        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Perched on a hillside between Lagos and the dramatic sea cliffs of Ponta da Piedade, the Solar Studio occupies a renovated quinta (traditional Algarve farmhouse) with modern sustainable additions. The 30kW solar array across the roof and carport generates more electricity than the property consumes on most days, feeding surplus back to the Portuguese grid. Each studio has its own private terrace with Atlantic views. The ground floor co-working space opens onto a courtyard where the organic garden grows tomatoes, herbs, citrus, and figs. The Algarve's 300-plus sunshine days per year make this one of the most solar-productive nomad stays on Earth.</p>
