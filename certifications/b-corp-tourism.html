In tourism, Certified B Corporations include tour operators, accommodation providers, and destination management organizations that balance profit with purpose across five impact areas: Governance, Workers, Community, Environment, and Customers."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does B Corp certification work?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Companies complete the B Impact Assessment scoring across Governance, Workers, Community, Environment, and Customers. They must score at least 80 out of 200 points, undergo verification by B Lab, amend legal documents for stakeholder governance, and recertify every three years. The process typically takes 12-18 months."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What does B Corp assess in tourism businesses?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Governance (transparency, mission alignment), Workers (compensation, benefits, safety, diversity), Community (local economic impact, supplier diversity, charitable giving), Environment (energy, water, waste, emissions, biodiversity, supply chain), and Customers (quality, ethical marketing, data privacy). Tourism-specific considerations include community benefit sharing and cultural preservation."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How many tourism businesses are B Corp certified?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Several hundred tourism businesses worldwide hold B Corp certification as of 2026, including Intrepid Travel.

The tourism B Corp community is growing rapidly."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does B Corp differ from environmental certifications?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"B Corp evaluates the entire business across social and environmental dimensions, while EarthCheck or Travelife focus on environmental operations. B Corp assesses worker treatment, governance, community impact alongside environment. It requires legal structural changes. B Corp is strongest on social dimensions that environmental certifications underweight."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is B Corp certification credible for evaluating eco-resorts?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Highly credible for holistic business responsibility. The 80-point threshold is demanding (median business scores 50.9), three-year recertification ensures accountability, and public score transparency is unique. However, it lacks tourism-specific granular environmental data. Best combined with tourism-specific certifications like EarthCheck."}}]}

        <h2>What Is B Corp Certification?</h2>
        <p>B Corp certification is a designation awarded by B Lab, a global nonprofit organization founded in 2006 in Pennsylvania, USA. Certified B Corporations are businesses verified to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. The certification evaluates the entire business, not just a single product or operational dimension, making it one of the most comprehensive business certifications available.</p>
        <p>In the tourism industry, B Corp certification has gained significant traction as companies demonstrate that their sustainability commitment extends beyond environmental operations to encompass worker welfare, governance ethics, community impact, and customer responsibility. Notable B Corp certified tourism companies include Intrepid Travel, one of the world's largest adventure travel companies, along with growing numbers of boutique operators, accommodation providers, and travel technology platforms.</p>
        <p>The B Corp movement represents a fundamental shift in measuring business success. Rather than evaluating a company solely by financial performance, B Corp assessment asks: does this business create value for all stakeholders, including workers, communities, customers, and the environment, not just shareholders?</p>

        <h2>The B Impact Assessment</h2>
        <p>The core of B Corp certification is the B Impact Assessment (BIA), a comprehensive evaluation tool scoring businesses across five impact areas on a 200-point scale. Companies must score at least 80 points to qualify. The median business scores approximately 50.9 points, meaning the 80-point threshold represents genuinely above-average performance.</p>

        <h3>Governance (up to ~22 points)</h3>
        <p>Evaluates the company's mission, ethics, accountability, and transparency. For tourism businesses, this includes whether sustainability is embedded in decision-making, board diversity and independence, stakeholder engagement processes, ethical business practices, and transparency of social and environmental impact reporting.</p>
        <div class="sustainability-meter"><div class="meter-row"><span class="meter-label">Governance</span><div class="meter-bar"><div class="meter-fill meter-fill--community" style="width:85%"></div></div><span class="meter-value">85</span></div></div>

        <h3>Workers (up to ~50 points)</h3>
        <p>Assesses employee treatment including compensation relative to living wage, benefits provision, training opportunities, workplace safety, worker ownership arrangements, diversity and inclusion practices, and job satisfaction. In tourism, where labor exploitation is a significant concern, this dimension is particularly meaningful.</p>
        <div class="sustainability-meter"><div class="meter-row"><span class="meter-label">Workers</span><div class="meter-bar"><div class="meter-fill meter-fill--energy" style="width:88%"></div></div><span class="meter-value">88</span></div></div>

        <h3>Community (up to ~50 points)</h3>
        <p>Measures impact on operating communities. For tourism, this covers local economic benefit through employment and revenue sharing, supplier diversity and local sourcing, civic engagement and charitable giving, community development investments, and indigenous and cultural heritage respect.</p>
        <div class="sustainability-meter"><div class="meter-row"><span class="meter-label">Community</span><div class="meter-bar"><div class="meter-fill meter-fill--water" style="width:90%"></div></div><span class="meter-value">90</span></div></div>

        <h3>Environment (up to ~50 points)</h3>
        <p>Evaluates environmental management including energy consumption and renewables, water conservation, waste reduction and circular economy practices, greenhouse gas emissions, land stewardship and biodiversity, and supply chain environmental impact. While less granular than EarthCheck's per-guest-night benchmarking, this provides a solid overview of environmental responsibility.</p>
        <div class="sustainability-meter"><div class="meter-row"><span class="meter-label">Environment</span><div class="meter-bar"><div class="meter-fill meter-fill--waste" style="width:82%"></div></div><span class="meter-value">82</span></div></div>

        <h3>Customers (up to ~28 points)</h3>
        <p>Assesses value creation for customers including service quality, ethical marketing, data privacy, customer education about sustainability, and accessibility of offerings. For tourism, this includes whether the company helps travelers make responsible choices and whether marketing accurately represents sustainability claims.</p>

        <h2>The Legal Requirement</h2>
        <p>One unique aspect of B Corp certification is the legal requirement. Certified B Corporations must amend their legal governing documents to require consideration of all stakeholders in decision-making, not just shareholders. This structural change embeds B Corp commitment in the company's legal DNA, providing protection against future leadership changes that might deprioritize sustainability. Many companies adopt Benefit Corporation legal status to fulfill this requirement.</p>

        <h2>B Corp in Tourism: Notable Examples</h2>
        <p>Intrepid Travel, based in Melbourne, Australia, became one of the first major travel companies to achieve B Corp certification. With operations in over 100 countries and annual revenues exceeding $400 million, Intrepid demonstrated that B Corp certification is achievable at scale. Other notable B Corp tourism businesses span adventure travel, ecotourism, accommodation, and travel technology sectors across multiple continents.</p>
        <p>The growing B Corp tourism community creates a network of purpose-driven businesses that share best practices, collaborate on industry challenges, and collectively raise the bar for responsible tourism. B Corp certified companies publicly share their B Impact Assessment scores, creating unprecedented transparency in an industry often criticized for vague sustainability claims.</p>

        <h2>Strengths of B Corp for Tourism</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Holistic assessment:</strong> Evaluates the entire business across social, environmental, and governance dimensions.</li>
          <li><strong>Demanding threshold:</strong> The 80-point minimum is genuinely challenging, with the median business scoring only 50.9.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal accountability:</strong> Governance changes embed stakeholder consideration into the company's legal foundation.</li>
          <li><strong>Public transparency:</strong> All scores are publicly available for meaningful comparison.</li>
          <li><strong>Worker welfare:</strong> Strong labor assessment fills a gap that environmental certifications leave unaddressed.</li>
          <li><strong>Three-year recertification:</strong> Regular reassessment ensures ongoing improvement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Limitations and Honest Criticisms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Not tourism-specific:</strong> Lacks tourism metrics like energy per guest night that EarthCheck provides.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-reported data:</strong> Initial assessment relies on self-reported information, though B Lab verifies.</li>
          <li><strong>Size bias:</strong> May favor larger companies with resources for formal programs and documentation.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost and complexity:</strong> The 12-18 month process may be prohibitive for small operators.</li>
          <li><strong>Environmental depth:</strong> Less granular operational environmental data than dedicated environmental certifications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>EcoRenter's Assessment</h2>
        <p>EcoRenter considers B Corp certification a strong positive indicator of holistic business responsibility. Its assessment of governance, workers, and community impact fills critical gaps that environmental certifications often leave unaddressed. B Corp certification contributes positively to our evidence tier system, with particular weight given to community and governance dimensions. For the most comprehensive sustainability picture, we look for tourism businesses that combine B Corp with tourism-specific environmental certifications like EarthCheck or Travelife.</p>
