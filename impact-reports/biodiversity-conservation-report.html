    <!-- Detailed Report -->
    <article class="section">
      <div class="container container--narrow">

        <h2>The Conservation-Tourism Nexus</h2>
        <p>Eco-tourism's most powerful conservation argument is economic: when wild landscapes generate more revenue from tourism than from extraction (logging, mining, agriculture), preservation becomes the rational economic choice. This argument holds in many contexts but requires careful examination. Tourism revenue must be sufficient, stable, and distributed to the people who bear the costs of living alongside wildlife.</p>
        <p>Across EcoRenter-listed properties, conservation programs are funded through direct conservation fees (average $25-50 per guest-night at safari lodges, $10-20 at rainforest lodges), community conservancy lease payments, percentage-of-revenue contributions (typically 2-5% of gross revenue), and specific project funding from guest donations and partnerships.</p>

        <h2>Kenya: Savanna and Wildlife Conservation</h2>
        <p>Kenyan eco-tourism properties in EcoRenter's database contribute to the protection of approximately 520,000 acres of savanna, grassland, and highland forest across Laikipia, Amboseli, Mara, and Lewa conservancies. Key conservation outcomes include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Black rhino:</strong> 12 listed properties contribute to protecting a population of approximately 45 black rhinos across their conservancy areas. Anti-poaching spending from tourism revenue totals $680,000 annually, funding 67 community rangers.</li>
          <li><strong>Grevy's zebra:</strong> Listed properties in Laikipia protect habitat for approximately 380 Grevy's zebras, representing 15% of the global population of this Endangered species.</li>
          <li><strong>African wild dog:</strong> Tourism-funded monitoring and corridor projects support a population of approximately 120 wild dogs across connected conservancy areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Elephant corridors:</strong> 8 wildlife corridor projects totaling 45,000 acres maintain connectivity between Amboseli, Tsavo, and Kilimanjaro ecosystems, enabling seasonal elephant migration for approximately 2,000 individuals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Conservation challenge: Human-wildlife conflict remains the primary threat. Elephants damaging crops, lions killing livestock, and competition for water during drought create tensions that conservation fees alone cannot fully resolve. Successful properties combine tourism revenue with crop insurance programs, predator-proof enclosures for livestock, and water infrastructure that serves both wildlife and community needs.</p>

        <h2>Costa Rica: Tropical Forest and Marine Conservation</h2>
        <p>Costa Rican properties contribute to protecting approximately 380,000 acres of tropical rainforest, cloud forest, and marine habitat. Costa Rica's national conservation system (25% of land area is protected) provides a strong foundation that tourism complements through buffer zone management and corridor connectivity.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scarlet macaw:</strong> Reforestation and nest box programs at Osa Peninsula properties have contributed to a population recovery from 400 to approximately 800 individuals over the past decade.</li>
          <li><strong>Jaguar:</strong> Camera trap monitoring funded by 6 listed properties tracks approximately 35 jaguars across the Osa-Corcovado corridor, with corridor connectivity maintained by tourism land purchases.</li>
          <li><strong>Sea turtles:</strong> 4 listed coastal properties fund night patrols protecting approximately 2,400 sea turtle nests annually, with hatchling survival rates of 65-75%.</li>
          <li><strong>Reforestation:</strong> Costa Rican listed properties have planted 1.1 million native trees since 2020, restoring 7,200 acres of degraded pastureland to secondary forest with an average survival rate of 78%.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Colombia: Andean and Amazon Biodiversity</h2>
        <p>Colombian properties in EcoRenter's database contribute to protecting approximately 180,000 acres spanning Andean cloud forest, Amazon transition zones, and Pacific coastal mangroves. Colombia's status as the world's second most biodiverse country (after Brazil) makes these conservation contributions particularly significant.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spectacled bear:</strong> Tourism-funded monitoring tracks approximately 25 spectacled bears in Andean cloud forest reserves connected to 3 listed properties.</li>
          <li><strong>Andean condor:</strong> Habitat protection and anti-poisoning programs funded by highland eco-lodges protect nesting sites for approximately 15 breeding pairs.</li>
          <li><strong>Amazon connectivity:</strong> 2 listed properties in the Amazon transition zone maintain 35,000 acres of forest buffer preventing agricultural encroachment into primary Amazon forest.</li>
          <li><strong>Mangrove restoration:</strong> Pacific coast properties have restored 450 acres of mangrove habitat, providing nursery habitat for marine species and coastal protection equivalent to $2.3 million in infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Monitoring Gap</h2>
        <p>The most significant limitation in this report is the monitoring gap. While 65% of listed properties claim conservation programs, only 28% conduct formal biodiversity monitoring using recognized scientific protocols. The remaining 72% rely on informal observation, anecdotal evidence, or no monitoring at all. Without baseline data and systematic monitoring, conservation impact claims cannot be verified. EcoRenter is working with conservation partners to expand standardized monitoring across listed properties, with a target of 50% formal monitoring by 2028.</p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>Habitat acreage data is sourced from property surveys, conservancy records, and satellite imagery analysis. Species data comes from formal monitoring programs (camera traps, transect surveys) where available and property reports elsewhere. Reforestation data is self-reported by properties with survival rates verified through sample plot surveys at 35% of reporting properties. All aggregate figures should be interpreted with the monitoring gap in mind; actual conservation impact may be higher or lower than reported.</p>
