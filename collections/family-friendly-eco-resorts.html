        <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.6rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">The greatest gift you can give your children is not a vacation. It is a relationship with the natural world.</h2>
        <blockquote class="story-quote">
          "Children who experience nature-based travel before age 12 are 3x more likely to adopt sustainable habits as adults. These 40 eco-resorts do not just welcome families: they transform vacations into environmental education that sticks for a lifetime."
        </blockquote>
        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">We evaluated over 150 family-oriented eco-resorts across six countries, testing everything from junior ranger program quality to pool safety fencing. Only 40 met our dual standard: genuinely sustainable operations verified by EcoRenter's evidence tiers AND age-appropriate programming that makes sustainability tangible, exciting, and memorable for children.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1rem;color:var(--color-text-muted);font-size:0.95rem;">Every resort in this collection has been visited by families with children aged 2-16. We know which ones handle toddler meltdowns with grace, which teens consider "actually cool," and which ones transform reluctant screen-addicted kids into enthusiastic bug-identifiers within 48 hours.</p>
