    <!-- Glossary Content -->
    <article class="section">
      <div class="container container--narrow">

        <h2>A</h2>
        <p><strong>Agritourism:</strong> Tourism that connects visitors to agricultural practices, including farm stays, harvest experiences, and food production education. Genuine agritourism supports working farms and rural livelihoods, not just farm-themed photo opportunities.</p>
        <p><strong>Additionality:</strong> The principle that a carbon offset project must produce emission reductions that would not have occurred without the offset funding. A reforestation project on land that was going to be replanted anyway lacks additionality. This is the most contested and critical concept in carbon offset quality.</p>

        <h2>B</h2>
        <p><strong>Bioregion:</strong> A geographic area defined by natural boundaries (watersheds, ecosystems, topography) rather than political borders. Bioregional tourism aligns travel experiences with ecological regions, encouraging travelers to understand a place through its natural systems rather than its administrative boundaries.</p>
        <p><strong>Biodiversity Offset:</strong> Measurable conservation outcomes designed to compensate for residual biodiversity impacts of development. In tourism, this means protecting or restoring habitat elsewhere to compensate for habitat altered by resort construction. Quality and equivalence of offsets are debated.</p>
        <p><strong>Blue Economy:</strong> Sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and ocean ecosystem health. In tourism, this includes sustainable marine tourism, reef conservation programs, and coastal community development funded by tourism revenue.</p>

        <h2>C</h2>
        <p><strong>Carbon Neutral:</strong> A state where net carbon dioxide emissions are zero, achieved through a combination of emission reduction and carbon offsetting. Important distinction: carbon neutral allows any ratio of reduction to offset. A company can increase emissions and remain carbon neutral by buying more offsets.</p>
        <p><strong>Carrying Capacity:</strong> The maximum number of visitors a destination can accommodate without environmental degradation, cultural erosion, or diminished visitor experience. Encompasses physical, ecological, social, and perceptual dimensions. Exceeding carrying capacity leads to overtourism.</p>
        <p><strong>Circular Economy:</strong> An economic system that eliminates waste through continuous reuse, recycling, and regeneration of materials. In eco-resorts, this means composting food waste for gardens, recycling graywater for irrigation, and designing buildings for material recovery at end of life.</p>
        <p><strong>Community-Based Tourism (CBT):</strong> Tourism owned and managed by local communities for their direct benefit. CBT ensures that tourism revenue, employment, and decision-making power remain with host communities rather than being extracted by external operators.</p>

        <h2>D-E</h2>
        <p><strong>Degrowth Tourism:</strong> An approach that questions whether tourism growth is desirable, advocating for reduced visitor numbers, longer stays, and deeper engagement over increased volume and revenue. Degrowth tourism prioritizes well-being and ecological health over GDP contribution.</p>
        <p><strong>Ecolodge:</strong> Accommodation designed and operated to minimize environmental impact while providing nature-based guest experiences. Genuine ecolodges use local and sustainable building materials, minimize energy and water consumption, manage waste responsibly, and contribute to conservation and community development.</p>
        <p><strong>Ecotourism:</strong> Responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of local people, and involves interpretation and education (IUCN). Distinguished from nature tourism by its requirements for active conservation contribution, community benefit, and environmental education.</p>
        <p><strong>Embodied Energy:</strong> The total energy consumed throughout a product's lifecycle, from raw material extraction through manufacturing, transport, and disposal. In resort construction, embodied energy measures the environmental cost of building materials like concrete, steel, imported timber, and synthetic insulation.</p>

        <h2>F-G</h2>
        <p><strong>Fair Trade Tourism:</strong> Tourism certified to meet standards for fair wages, decent working conditions, equitable distribution of benefits, democracy, respect for human rights, and environmental sustainability. Similar to fair trade in agriculture but applied to the tourism supply chain.</p>
        <p><strong>Graywater:</strong> Wastewater from sinks, showers, and laundry that can be treated and reused for irrigation, toilet flushing, or cooling systems. Graywater recycling is a key water conservation practice at eco-resorts, reducing freshwater consumption by 30-50%.</p>
        <p><strong>Green Building:</strong> Construction that reduces environmental impact through energy efficiency, sustainable materials, water conservation, waste reduction, and healthy indoor environments. In tourism, green building certifications include LEED, BREEAM, and Green Star.</p>
        <p><strong>Greenwashing:</strong> Making misleading or false claims about environmental benefits. In tourism, this ranges from vague language to fabricated certifications. Approximately 40% of self-described eco-resorts exhibit greenwashing indicators.</p>

        <h2>L-N</h2>
        <p><strong>Leakage:</strong> The proportion of tourism revenue that leaves the local economy through imports, foreign ownership, expatriate wages, and overseas marketing costs. In many developing-country tourism destinations, leakage rates exceed 70%, meaning less than 30 cents of every tourist dollar benefits the local economy.</p>
        <p><strong>Leave No Trace:</strong> A set of seven principles for minimizing human impact on natural areas: plan ahead, travel on durable surfaces, dispose of waste properly, leave what you find, minimize campfire impacts, respect wildlife, and be considerate of others.</p>
        <p><strong>Nature-Based Solutions (NBS):</strong> Approaches that use natural processes and ecosystems to address societal challenges including climate change, water security, and disaster risk. In tourism, NBS includes mangrove restoration for coastal protection, wetland conservation for water purification, and urban green spaces for heat reduction.</p>
        <p><strong>Net Zero:</strong> Reducing emissions by at least 90% from a baseline year and permanently removing the residual unavoidable emissions from the atmosphere. More rigorous than carbon neutral because it requires deep emission cuts before any offsetting is applied.</p>

        <h2>O-P</h2>
        <p><strong>Overtourism:</strong> Excessive visitor numbers causing environmental degradation, infrastructure strain, cultural erosion, and reduced quality of life for residents. Destinations experiencing overtourism include Venice, Barcelona, Dubrovnik, and parts of Bali. Counter-strategies include visitor caps, seasonal pricing, and promoting alternative destinations.</p>
        <p><strong>Permaculture:</strong> A design system for creating sustainable human settlements based on natural ecosystem patterns. In eco-resorts, permaculture principles guide food gardens, water management, energy systems, and land use to create self-sustaining, regenerative systems.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro-Poor Tourism:</strong> Tourism that generates net benefits specifically for economically disadvantaged people, through employment, small enterprise development, and community revenue. The focus is on distributional equity, not just total economic output.</p>

        <h2>R-S</h2>
        <p><strong>Regenerative Tourism:</strong> Tourism that actively restores and improves destinations rather than merely minimizing harm. It goes beyond sustainability (maintaining) to regeneration (improving). Examples include reforestation funded by stays, reef restoration programs, and soil health improvement through agritourism.</p>
        <p><strong>Responsible Tourism:</strong> Tourism managed to maximize positive social, economic, and environmental impacts while minimizing negatives. Similar to sustainable tourism but with greater emphasis on the agency and responsibility of individual travelers and operators to make ethical choices.</p>
        <p><strong>Rewilding:</strong> Restoring natural processes and species to degraded ecosystems, often by removing human interference and reintroducing keystone species. Tourism-funded rewilding projects generate revenue for conservation through wildlife viewing, guided experiences, and eco-lodges in rewilded landscapes.</p>
        <p><strong>Slow Travel:</strong> An approach that prioritizes depth over breadth, advocating for extended stays in fewer destinations, ground transport over flights, and cultural immersion over checklist tourism. Slow travel reduces per-day carbon emissions and increases economic benefit to host communities.</p>
        <p><strong>Sustainable Development:</strong> Development that meets present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (Brundtland Commission, 1987). In tourism, this means operating within ecological limits while ensuring equitable distribution of benefits across present and future stakeholders.</p>
        <p><strong>Sustainable Tourism:</strong> Tourism that takes full account of current and future economic, social, and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment, and host communities (UNWTO). Applies to all forms of tourism, not just nature-based travel.</p>

        <h2>T-V</h2>
        <p><strong>Tourism Satellite Account (TSA):</strong> A statistical framework that measures the economic contribution of tourism to a national economy. TSA data enables governments to understand tourism's GDP contribution, employment generation, and foreign exchange earnings with precision.</p>
        <p><strong>Triple Bottom Line:</strong> A framework measuring organizational success across three dimensions: profit (economic), people (social), and planet (environmental). Eco-resorts using triple bottom line reporting track financial performance alongside community impact and environmental metrics.</p>
        <p><strong>Voluntourism:</strong> Combining volunteer work with tourism. Controversial because poorly designed programs can displace local workers, create dependency, perpetuate savior narratives, and prioritize volunteer experience over community benefit. Ethical voluntourism requires community-led project design, skilled volunteers, and long-term commitment.</p>

        <h2>W-Z</h2>
        <p><strong>Waste Diversion Rate:</strong> The percentage of total waste redirected from landfill or incineration through recycling, composting, reuse, and reduction. Top-performing eco-resorts achieve 80-95% diversion rates. The industry average is approximately 30%.</p>
        <p><strong>Water Footprint:</strong> The total volume of freshwater used to produce goods and services consumed by an individual or business. In tourism, water footprint includes direct use (showers, pools, laundry) and indirect use (food production, laundry services, landscaping). Measured in liters per guest-night.</p>
        <p><strong>Zero Waste:</strong> A philosophy and design principle targeting the elimination of all waste through redesigning products and processes, reusing materials, and recovering resources. In eco-resorts, zero waste means designing out disposable items, composting all organic waste, and recycling or repurposing the remainder. True zero waste (100% diversion) is an aspiration; practical targets are 90%+ diversion.</p>
