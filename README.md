## 🧠 Core Philosophy

EcoRenter is **not a booking platform**.  
It is a **sustainability-first travel knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- classify sustainability practices
- cluster stays by impact level
- translate environmental data
- generate eco-itineraries

Humans are required to:
- verify sustainability claims
- prevent greenwashing
- assess community impact
- approve eco-certifications

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

EcoRenter is built around **ecological and experiential entities**.

### Core Entities
- Eco-Resort / Ecolodge
- Destination
- Experience
- Sustainability Practice
- Certification / Proof
- Nomad Stay
- Impact Score
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links by impact, comfort, and duration
- is programmatically generatable
