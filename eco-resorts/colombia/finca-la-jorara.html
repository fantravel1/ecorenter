    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What makes the shade-grown coffee special?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Finca La Jorara grows arabica coffee at 1,400 meters elevation under a native tree canopy that includes guamo, carbonero, and cedro species. This shade-grown approach mimics the forest ecosystem, providing habitat for migratory birds and insects while producing coffee cherries that ripen slowly, developing complex flavors that command specialty market prices. No synthetic pesticides or fertilizers are used. Composted coffee pulp provides soil nutrition. The shade canopy reduces water evaporation, meaning the finca uses approximately 40% less irrigation water than sun-grown operations at similar elevations. Annual production is approximately 5 tonnes of green coffee, sold through direct trade to specialty roasters in the US and Europe at prices 60% above commodity rates."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How does the Arhuaco cultural exchange work?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The Arhuaco people are one of four indigenous groups who consider the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta their ancestral homeland. Finca La Jorara's cultural exchange is facilitated through a formal agreement with Arhuaco community leaders. Visits are hosted by Arhuaco families who choose to participate, in their own communities and on their own terms. Guests learn about Arhuaco cosmology -- their understanding of the mountain as a living body that must be kept in balance -- traditional weaving techniques for the iconic mochila bags, and sustainable farming practices that predate European contact by millennia. A portion of the exchange fee goes directly to the Arhuaco community fund for healthcare and education. No photographs of sacred sites or ceremonies are permitted."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What does 100% local staff mean in practice?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Every person who works at Finca La Jorara is from the Sierra Nevada region. The farm manager grew up on a neighboring finca. The coffee processing team includes second-generation coffee workers who learned the craft from their parents. Kitchen staff prepare regional dishes using recipes passed down through families. Guides are local naturalists who know every trail, bird call, and plant species from a lifetime in the mountain. The finca pays above regional wages and provides year-round employment rather than seasonal work, which is the norm in coffee farming. Staff families receive healthcare benefits and their children receive education support through the finca's scholarship fund."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What sustainability challenges does the finca face?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "As a Tier C property, Finca La Jorara has genuine sustainability commitments but limited documentation and third-party verification. The finca operates without formal organic certification (though practices are organic), energy systems are basic, and waste management relies on traditional rather than engineered solutions. The property generates approximately 68% of its energy from a small solar array supplemented by grid power. Water management relies on the mountain's natural springs with minimal treatment infrastructure. These limitations are transparently acknowledged, and the finca represents a different model of sustainability: deep community integration and agricultural stewardship rather than technological sophistication."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is Finca La Jorara's evidence tier?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Finca La Jorara holds EcoRenter's Tier C verification, meaning the property has self-reported sustainability data with limited external corroboration. Coffee production records are maintained internally. Arhuaco cultural exchange agreements are documented through community partnership records. Energy and water systems are self-monitored without independent verification. The Tier C designation reflects genuine sustainability practices that have not yet been subjected to third-party assessment, not a judgment on the property's commitment or impact."}}

          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Coffee from the Heart of the World</h2>

          <p>The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is the world's highest coastal mountain range, rising from Caribbean sea level to 5,775 meters in just 42 kilometers. This compressed altitudinal gradient creates a stacking of ecosystems found nowhere else on Earth -- from mangrove swamps through tropical dry forest, cloud forest, and paramo to permanent snow. At 1,400 meters, in the coffee belt where clouds and sunshine alternate throughout the day, Finca La Jorara has been growing coffee for three generations. What makes this finca different is not its coffee -- though its shade-grown arabica is exceptional -- but its relationships: with the land, with the Arhuaco people who consider this mountain sacred, and with the local community that runs it.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The current owner, the grandson of the finca's founder, made a deliberate choice in 2015 to transition from conventional coffee production to what he calls "relational agriculture" -- farming that prioritizes relationships between plants, animals, people, and the broader ecosystem. He removed all synthetic inputs, restored native shade trees, began composting coffee pulp instead of dumping it in streams, and opened the finca to visitors who wanted to understand where their coffee comes from. The transformation took three years before the first guests arrived, and the coffee itself took two additional years to reach the quality levels that specialty buyers demand.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Coffee: Shade-Grown Excellence</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Finca La Jorara's arabica coffee grows beneath a canopy of native guamo, carbonero, and cedro trees that provide shade, nitrogen fixation, and habitat. This shade-grown approach produces coffee cherries that ripen slowly, developing the complex flavors -- bright acidity, chocolate notes, tropical fruit finish -- that specialty roasters prize. No synthetic pesticides or fertilizers touch the plants. Composted coffee pulp, enriched with worm castings from a vermicomposting operation, provides all soil nutrition. The shade canopy reduces water evaporation by approximately 40% compared to sun-grown operations. Annual production is 5 tonnes of green coffee, sold through direct trade at prices 60% above commodity rates to specialty roasters in New York, Portland, and Amsterdam. Guests experience the full seed-to-cup journey: picking ripe cherries, wet processing, fermentation monitoring, drying on raised beds, hand sorting, and roasting in a traditional drum roaster.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community: Arhuaco Cosmology</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The Arhuaco people have lived on the Sierra Nevada for over a thousand years. Their cosmology positions the mountain as the Heart of the World -- a living body whose health determines the health of the entire planet. This is not metaphor; it is lived reality for the Arhuaco, and it shapes their relationship with every aspect of their environment. Finca La Jorara's cultural exchange, facilitated through formal agreement with community leaders, gives guests access to this profound worldview. Visits to Arhuaco communities are hosted by families who choose to participate, on their own terms. Guests learn about sustainable farming practices that predate European contact, traditional weaving of the iconic mochila bags, and the spiritual significance of the mountain's water systems. The exchange fee goes directly to the Arhuaco community fund. Photography of sacred sites is prohibited, and the finca refuses any request to facilitate access that the community has not explicitly approved.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Staff: 100% Sierra Nevada</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Every person at Finca La Jorara is from the Sierra Nevada region. The farm manager grew up on a neighboring finca. Coffee processing workers include second-generation craftspeople. Kitchen staff prepare regional dishes from family recipes. Guides are local naturalists with lifetime knowledge of every trail and bird call. The finca pays above regional wages and provides year-round employment rather than the seasonal work standard in coffee farming. Staff families receive healthcare benefits and children receive education support through a scholarship fund. This model keeps income within the community and ensures that the knowledge embedded in the operation is local knowledge -- the kind that no training manual can replace.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Biodiversity: The Canopy Effect</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The shade-grown coffee system supports remarkable biodiversity for an agricultural operation. Bird surveys have recorded over 180 species within the finca's boundaries, including several migratory warblers from North America that depend on shade coffee habitat during winter. The multi-layer canopy provides habitat for howler monkeys, sloths, and a diversity of amphibians that rivals nearby protected forest. The finca maintains two hectares of unmanaged forest as a wildlife corridor connecting coffee areas to the adjacent Sierra Nevada protected zone. A monitoring program tracks bird diversity as an indicator of ecosystem health, with data suggesting that bird populations have increased by approximately 25% since the transition to shade-grown methods.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Energy and Infrastructure</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Finca La Jorara operates with basic but functional sustainability infrastructure. A small 8 kW solar array provides approximately 68% of electricity for guest accommodation and the coffee processing facility. The remaining power comes from the local grid. Hot water is heated by a wood-fired system using prunings from the shade trees -- a renewable fuel source that is a byproduct of normal farm management. Cooking uses a combination of gas and a traditional wood-fired fogon that doubles as a social gathering space in the kitchen. Water comes from a mountain spring, gravity-fed to the finca without pumping. Composting toilets are used in the guest cabins, with the compost applied only to non-food-producing areas after full decomposition.</p>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Limited Documentation:</strong> As a Tier C property, many sustainability claims are self-reported without independent verification. Guests should understand this limitation.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Basic Infrastructure:</strong> Accommodation is simple -- composting toilets, limited hot water, no AC. The finca experience is authentic but rustic.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>No Organic Certification:</strong> Despite organic practices, the finca has not obtained formal certification, which limits its ability to command the highest prices and prevents formal organic claims.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Grid Dependency:</strong> 32% of electricity comes from the grid. The small solar array is insufficient for full energy independence, particularly during cloudy mountain weather.</p>
