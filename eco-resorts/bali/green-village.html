        <div class="story-content">
          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Architecture as Ecosystem</h2>

          <p>In 2010, jewelry designer John Hardy and his daughter Elora looked at the dense bamboo groves lining Bali's river valleys and saw not just a building material but a manifesto. Bamboo -- the fastest-growing plant on earth, capable of reaching full maturity in just three years -- represented everything conventional construction was not: renewable, carbon-sequestering, earthquake-resistant, and beautiful. Green Village was born from a simple but radical question: could an entire community be built from a single sustainable material without sacrificing any element of modern comfort or architectural ambition?</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The answer stands along the Ayung River today. Eighteen bamboo houses, no two alike, rise from the valley like organic sculptures. Some soar six stories into the canopy. Others curl around boulders and trees. Elora Hardy's design firm Ibuku created each structure as a unique response to its specific site, the bamboo's natural curves, and the client's needs. The result is a living laboratory for sustainable architecture that has influenced building practices across Southeast Asia and earned recognition from the World Architecture Festival, the American Institute of Architects, and the United Nations.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Energy: River and Sun</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Green Village generates its power from two complementary renewable sources. A custom micro-hydro vortex turbine installed in the Ayung River produces approximately 8.5 kW of continuous electricity, harnessing the river's consistent flow without damming or diverting it. Solar panels integrated into the bamboo roofing structures add additional capacity during daylight hours. Combined, these systems provide over 95% of the village's electricity needs. A lithium-ion battery bank stores surplus energy for overnight use and cloudy-day backup. The remaining 5% comes from grid connection used primarily for surge capacity during full occupancy. The open-air bamboo architecture eliminates the need for air conditioning entirely, with natural cross-ventilation and the river valley's cooling breezes maintaining comfortable temperatures year-round.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Waste: The Zero-Plastic Village</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Green Village's zero-plastic policy goes far beyond replacing straws. Every single-use plastic item has been systematically replaced with a sustainable alternative. Toiletries come in refillable bamboo containers with locally made organic products. Water is filtered on-site and served in glass carafes. Kitchen supplies arrive from vendors who have agreed to plastic-free packaging, with containers returned for reuse. The village composts all organic waste in a three-stage vermicomposting system that produces rich soil for the permaculture gardens. Non-organic waste is sorted into 12 categories for recycling through Bali's Eco-Bali Recycling network. Annual waste audits show the village has eliminated over 12,000 plastic items per year and diverts 94% of all waste from landfill.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community: Building Skills, Building Futures</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">More than 80 local staff from surrounding villages work at Green Village, from maintenance and hospitality to the specialized bamboo craftspeople who keep the structures in pristine condition. The Ibuku Bamboo Construction Training Program, based at the village, has graduated over 200 Balinese builders in advanced bamboo construction techniques, creating an entirely new skilled trade in the region. These graduates have gone on to build bamboo structures across Indonesia and beyond, multiplying the village's impact far beyond its own boundaries. Green Village also provides scholarships for local children to attend the nearby Green School, and its artisan workshop sells handmade goods from seven village cooperatives at fair-trade prices.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Bamboo: The Sustainable Supermaterial</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Every bamboo pole used in Green Village comes from managed groves within a 15-kilometer radius. The village uses primarily Dendrocalamus asper, a giant bamboo species that can grow up to 30 centimeters per day and reaches harvest maturity in just three to five years -- compared to 25 to 80 years for hardwood timber. Each harvested culm is treated with a proprietary borax solution that protects against insects and moisture, giving the bamboo a structural lifespan of 25 years or more. The treatment process uses no toxic chemicals. The managed groves from which the bamboo is sourced sequester an estimated 12 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year, making bamboo construction actively carbon-negative.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">River Stewardship</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The Ayung River is not just Green Village's power source but its neighbor and responsibility. The village maintains a 20-meter riparian buffer zone along the entire riverbank within its property, planted with native species to prevent erosion and filter runoff. A monthly river cleanup program, involving staff and guests, removes debris from a 2-kilometer stretch. Water quality is tested quarterly by an independent lab, and results are published on the village's website. The micro-hydro system includes a fish-safe intake design that prevents aquatic wildlife from entering the turbine, and its operation is monitored by the local water authority.</p>

          <p>No resort is perfect. Here is what we document alongside the strengths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Premium Pricing:</strong> Green Village's bespoke bamboo houses command luxury-level rates that exclude budget travelers. The cost of maintaining handcrafted bamboo structures is significantly higher than conventional buildings.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Bamboo Maintenance:</strong> Despite treatment, bamboo structures require ongoing maintenance in Bali's tropical climate. Periodic replacement of structural elements generates some waste, though bamboo is fully compostable.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Open-Air Limitations:</strong> The open-air design that eliminates AC also means exposure to insects and occasional rain intrusion. Mosquito nets and natural repellents are provided but may not suit all guests.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Access and Transport:</strong> The village's riverside location requires vehicle access on narrow roads. Most guests arrive by private car or taxi, and the property does not yet offer electric vehicle charging or shuttle services.</p>

                <p>Green Village features 18 houses designed by Ibuku, the world-renowned bamboo architecture firm. Each structure is crafted from locally harvested bamboo treated with a borax solution for longevity. Buildings soar up to six stories with no two structures alike, using traditional Balinese joinery alongside modern engineering.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>A custom micro-hydro vortex turbine in the Ayung River generates approximately 8.5 kW of continuous power using a run-of-river approach that requires no damming. Combined with rooftop solar, the system provides over 95% of electricity needs with battery storage for overnight use.</p>
