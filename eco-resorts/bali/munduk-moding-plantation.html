          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Above the Clouds, Rooted in the Soil</h2>

          <p>North Bali is a world away from the beaches and nightlife of the south. Here, at 1100 meters above sea level, the air is cool, mist clings to volcanic slopes, and the landscape is dominated by the same crops that have sustained mountain villages for over a century: coffee, clove, and cacao. Munduk Moding Plantation occupies a 15-hectare estate that has been in continuous agricultural production since the Dutch colonial period, when these highlands were first planted with Arabica coffee in the early 1900s.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">When the current owners acquired the property in 2012, they faced a choice that confronts many rural landowners across Bali: convert to tourism and abandon agriculture, or find a way to make both work. They chose integration. The resort was designed not to replace the plantation but to celebrate it, building guest accommodation among the coffee groves rather than clearing them, and making the agricultural operation itself the primary guest experience. The result is a property where the line between farm and hotel barely exists.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Energy: Volcanic Gifts</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Bali's volcanic geology provides Munduk Moding with a gift that most resorts must pay dearly for: hot water. Natural geothermal springs on the property emerge at temperatures between 38 and 45 degrees Celsius, feeding guest bathing pools directly and pre-heating the resort's domestic hot water system. This geothermal pre-heating reduces the energy needed for water heating by approximately 60%. Solar panels installed on service buildings generate additional electricity, and the combination of geothermal and solar currently meets approximately 78% of total energy needs. The resort's elevation means temperatures rarely exceed 26 degrees Celsius, eliminating the need for air conditioning entirely. Ceiling fans in guest rooms, powered by the solar system, provide sufficient cooling even on the warmest days.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community: The Coffee Cooperative</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Munduk Moding Plantation employs over 120 staff from surrounding mountain villages, making it the largest employer in the Munduk area outside of agriculture. But its community impact extends further through the Munduk Coffee Cooperative, which the resort helped establish in 2015. The cooperative allows neighboring smallholder coffee farmers to process and sell their beans through the plantation's direct-trade channels, bypassing intermediaries who typically capture most of the value chain. Cooperative members typically earn 40% above market rates for their beans. The resort also funds a village school library program in three surrounding villages, sponsors traditional Balinese dance and gamelan music instruction for local youth, and hosts an annual harvest festival that has become the region's largest cultural celebration.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Water: Mountain Spring Management</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">At 1100 meters, water management is both a privilege and a responsibility. The plantation sits within a critical watershed area that feeds villages and rice terraces downslope. All water used by the resort comes from on-property springs, carefully managed to ensure that withdrawal rates never exceed natural recharge. Greywater is treated through a constructed wetland system planted with local bamboo and water hyacinth before being used for garden and plantation irrigation. The resort monitors spring flow rates monthly and voluntarily reduces occupancy during rare dry-season low-flow periods. The geothermal pool water, rich in natural minerals, is cooled and directed to specific coffee groves where the mineral content has been shown to improve soil health.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Heritage Coffee: Seed to Cup</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The plantation cultivates both Arabica and Robusta varieties using shade-grown methods beneath the original clove and cacao canopy trees that have provided natural pest control and nitrogen fixation for decades. No synthetic pesticides or fertilizers are used. Coffee cherry processing follows the traditional wet method, with wastewater from processing treated in a biodigester that produces methane for the plantation's drying facility. Guests can participate in every stage of the coffee journey -- picking ripe cherries, operating the hand-powered pulping machine, monitoring fermentation, sun-drying on raised beds, and roasting in a wood-fired drum roaster. The plantation produces approximately 8 tonnes of green coffee annually, with 70% sold through direct-trade channels and 30% served to resort guests.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Biodiversity: The Living Canopy</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The shade-grown coffee system supports a remarkable level of biodiversity for an agricultural operation. A 2019 survey conducted in partnership with Udayana University recorded 87 bird species, 23 butterfly species, and over 40 species of epiphytic orchids within the plantation boundaries. The multilayer canopy -- emergent clove trees, mid-story cacao, understory coffee, and ground-cover herbs -- mimics the structure of natural forest, providing habitat for wildlife including the Bali starling, one of the world's rarest birds. The plantation maintains three hectares of unmanaged forest along its northern boundary as a dedicated wildlife corridor connecting to the Batukaru protection forest.</p>

          <p>No resort is perfect. Here is what we document alongside the strengths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Remote Location:</strong> Munduk is a 2.5-hour drive from Ngurah Rai Airport through winding mountain roads. Most guests arrive by private car, generating significant transport emissions that offset some on-site sustainability gains.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Grid Dependency:</strong> While 78% renewable, the resort still relies on grid electricity for 22% of its needs, including kitchen equipment and laundry facilities. Full renewable transition is planned but requires additional investment.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Seasonal Limitations:</strong> The wet season (November-March) brings heavy rainfall that can limit outdoor activities and reduce solar generation. Geothermal output remains consistent but overall renewable percentage drops during these months.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Limited Accessibility:</strong> The plantation's hillside terrain and stepped pathways present challenges for guests with mobility limitations. Only the main restaurant and lobby areas are fully wheelchair accessible.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" role="region">
              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Natural geothermal springs on the property emerge at 38-45 degrees Celsius, feeding bathing pools and pre-heating the domestic hot water system. This reduces water heating energy by approximately 60%. Combined with solar panels, 78% of energy needs are met renewably.</p>
