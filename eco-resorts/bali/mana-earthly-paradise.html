          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Growing a Retreat From the Ground Up</h2>

          <p>Mana Earthly Paradise began not as a resort concept but as a permaculture project. The founders acquired degraded agricultural land outside Ubud and began the slow work of soil restoration, food forest planting, and natural building. Years before the first guest arrived, the land was being healed -- topsoil rebuilt through composting, water systems restored through swale design, and native plant species reintroduced. The accommodation evolved organically from this foundation: as the food forest matured and the natural buildings took shape, visitors began asking to stay and learn.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Today, Mana offers a different kind of Bali experience. There are no infinity pools overlooking rice terraces here. Instead, guests wake to the sounds of a working organic farm, participate in morning harvest, learn to build with bamboo and earth, and eat meals prepared entirely from ingredients grown within walking distance. It is permaculture not as theory but as daily practice.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Food: Every Meal Has a Story</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The organic farm at Mana produces an extraordinary diversity of tropical foods. Layered food forests combine fruit trees (jackfruit, papaya, banana, mango) with mid-story plants (coffee, cacao, moringa) and ground-level crops (turmeric, ginger, leafy greens). Rotational vegetable beds supply seasonal produce. A vermiculture system produces rich compost that feeds the soil. The kitchen works directly with what the farm provides each day, creating menus that change with the seasons and the harvest. Approximately 75% of all food served comes from on-site, with the remainder sourced from neighboring organic farmers. Zero food waste is generated -- every scrap returns to compost or animal feed.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Building: Earth, Bamboo, and Hands</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Every structure at Mana was built using natural materials sourced within the local area. Bamboo forms the primary structural element, with rammed earth walls providing thermal mass that keeps interiors cool during hot days and warm during cool nights. Stone foundations come from local quarries. Reclaimed teak from demolished traditional houses provides detailing. Some structures experiment with earthbag techniques and cob construction. Natural insulation from coconut fiber and rice husks enhances comfort. The buildings themselves serve as educational tools -- guests can see and touch every material and learn the techniques during hands-on workshops.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Education: Knowledge as Impact</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Perhaps Mana's most significant contribution is its education program. Regular workshops cover permaculture design certification, natural building techniques, organic cooking, composting systems, water management, and medicinal plant cultivation. These workshops are open to both guests and local community members, with subsidized rates for Balinese participants. Over 500 graduates of Mana's programs have gone on to implement permaculture designs in their own homes and communities, creating a multiplier effect that extends the retreat's impact far beyond its physical boundaries.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Water and Energy: Working With Nature</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Rainwater harvesting provides a significant portion of the property's water needs. Swales and ponds capture runoff, recharging groundwater and providing irrigation during dry periods. Greywater passes through constructed wetlands before being used for garden irrigation. Solar panels provide a portion of electricity, supplemented by grid power. The natural building design -- thick earth walls, elevated bamboo structures, strategic ventilation -- reduces energy needs dramatically compared to conventional construction.</p>

        <div class="section-header"><span class="section-label">Honest Assessment</span><h2 id="tradeoffs-heading">Trade-offs and Limitations</h2></div>
        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Energy Independence Gap:</strong> Mana has not achieved full energy independence. Solar panels cover only a portion of electricity needs, with the remainder drawn from Bali's fossil-fuel grid. This is the primary factor in the lower energy score.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Basic Comfort Level:</strong> Natural buildings, while beautiful and educational, offer a more basic comfort level than conventional resorts. This is by design but may not suit all travelers.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>No Formal Certification:</strong> Despite strong practices, Mana has not pursued formal third-party certification, keeping it at Tier B. The focus has been on practice over paperwork.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Scale Constraints:</strong> As a small property, Mana's direct community economic impact is limited compared to larger operations, though the education multiplier effect extends reach significantly.</p>
