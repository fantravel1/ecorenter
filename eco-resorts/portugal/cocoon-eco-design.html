Cocoon's walls are 60 cm thick, providing exceptional thermal mass that absorbs heat during the day and releases it at night, dramatically reducing heating and cooling needs. The soil is excavated on-site, eliminating transportation emissions. Rammed earth has virtually zero embodied energy compared to concrete or steel, and at end of life, walls can be returned to the earth with no toxic legacy. The walls also regulate humidity naturally, creating healthy indoor air quality without mechanical systems."

Cork is harvested from living trees without harming them -- the bark regenerates every nine years -- making it one of the most sustainable insulation materials on earth. The cork forests from which Cocoon sources its insulation are FSC certified and located within 80 kilometers of the property. Cork provides excellent thermal and acoustic insulation, is naturally fire-resistant, hypoallergenic, and fully biodegradable. It also sequesters carbon both in the growing trees and in the finished product."

The solar thermal system provides 100% of hot water needs from April through October and approximately 70% during winter months. Photovoltaic panels generate approximately 90% of the property's electricity needs annually. The bioclimatic design of the buildings -- south-facing windows, rammed earth thermal mass, cork insulation, cross-ventilation -- reduces energy demand by an estimated 65% compared to conventional construction, meaning the solar systems need to power far less. A heat pump provides supplementary heating during cold winter nights."

The collected water passes through sediment filters and UV treatment before being used for all non-drinking purposes: toilet flushing, garden irrigation, laundry, and cleaning. During Comporta's wet season (October through March), the cisterns provide 100% of non-potable water needs.

          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Building from the Ground Up -- Literally</h2>

          <p>Comporta has become one of Europe's most fashionable beach destinations, but behind the boutiques and beach clubs, the Alentejo coast retains something increasingly rare in southern Europe: a vast, relatively undeveloped landscape of rice paddies, cork oak forests, and salt marshes. When architect Joana Astolfi set out to create Cocoon Eco Design in 2017, she wanted to prove that development in this sensitive landscape could enhance rather than degrade it. Her solution was to build with the land itself.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The lodges at Cocoon are constructed from rammed earth -- soil excavated from the building site, mixed with a minimal cement binder, and compressed into formwork to create walls 60 centimeters thick. These walls do not merely contain space; they regulate it. The thermal mass absorbs heat during Alentejo's scorching summers and releases it during cool winter nights, maintaining comfortable temperatures year-round with minimal mechanical assistance. Insulated with cork bark from nearby certified forests and topped with green roofs planted with native Mediterranean species, the buildings disappear into the landscape as naturally as the hills they were carved from.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Energy: Bioclimatic Intelligence</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Cocoon's energy story begins with demand reduction. The bioclimatic design -- south-facing windows for winter solar gain, deep overhangs for summer shade, cross-ventilation corridors, 60 cm rammed earth thermal mass, and cork insulation -- reduces energy demand by approximately 65% compared to conventional construction in the region. Solar thermal panels provide 100% of hot water from April through October and 70% during winter. Photovoltaic panels on service buildings generate approximately 90% of electricity needs annually. The remaining 10% comes from Portugal's national grid, which itself is increasingly renewable (over 60% in 2024). A ground-source heat pump provides supplementary heating during the coldest winter nights, using the earth's consistent subsurface temperature as an energy source.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Water: Rain and Reuse</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">In drought-prone southern Portugal, water management is paramount. Cocoon harvests rainwater from all roof surfaces into two underground cisterns totaling 50,000 liters. After sediment filtration and UV treatment, this water supplies all non-potable needs: toilets, laundry, cleaning, and irrigation. Greywater from showers and sinks passes through a constructed wetland before joining the irrigation system. The combination of rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling reduces municipal water consumption by 87%. Low-flow fixtures throughout further reduce demand. The property's landscaping uses exclusively native Mediterranean species that require no irrigation once established, and a drip irrigation system for the kitchen garden minimizes water waste.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Waste: Material Intelligence</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Cocoon's waste strategy begins at the design stage. All building materials were selected for their end-of-life characteristics: rammed earth returns to soil, cork is biodegradable, timber is FSC certified, and metals are recyclable. During operation, the property composts all organic waste in a three-bin system that produces soil amendment for the gardens. Single-use plastics were never introduced. Amenities are provided in refillable ceramic dispensers using Portuguese-made organic products. Kitchen waste that cannot be composted is minimized through careful meal planning based on seasonal local produce. The property achieves an 85% waste diversion rate, with the remaining 15% consisting primarily of non-recyclable packaging from suppliers.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Cork: Portugal's Gift to Sustainability</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Cork is central to Cocoon's sustainability story. Portugal produces over half the world's cork, and the cork oak forests (montados) of the Alentejo are among Europe's most biodiverse and carbon-sequestering landscapes. Cork harvesting involves stripping bark from living trees every nine years -- a process that stimulates new bark growth and increases the tree's carbon absorption. The cork used at Cocoon is sourced from FSC-certified montados within 80 kilometers. Expanded cork board insulates roofs and floors, providing thermal and acoustic performance comparable to synthetic insulation but with zero petrochemical content. Cork bark is also used for decorative elements, coasters, and even the yoga mats in the wellness area.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Landscape: Healing the Mediterranean</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The property's two-hectare site was previously degraded agricultural land. Cocoon's landscape restoration has replanted over 300 native species including stone pine, cork oak, strawberry tree, lavender, rosemary, and cistus. A wildflower meadow replacing former lawn provides habitat for pollinators, and the green roofs planted with native sedums and grasses support insect biodiversity. The kitchen garden operates on organic principles, supplying herbs, tomatoes, peppers, and leafy greens to the restaurant. The property's proximity to the Sado Estuary nature reserve -- home to resident bottlenose dolphins and nesting storks -- means that landscape management decisions are made with awareness of the broader ecosystem context.</p>

          <p>No resort is perfect. Here is what we document alongside the strengths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Construction Cost Premium:</strong> Rammed earth construction costs approximately 20-30% more than conventional building in Portugal, reflected in room rates that exclude budget travelers.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Winter Heating Limitations:</strong> Despite excellent thermal mass, Alentejo winters occasionally require supplementary heating. The heat pump system, while efficient, still consumes grid electricity during these periods.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Small Scale:</strong> With limited rooms, the property's total impact is modest in absolute terms even though per-guest metrics are exemplary.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Car Dependency:</strong> Comporta lacks public transport. Most guests arrive by car from Lisbon, generating transport emissions that are not captured in on-site metrics.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Solar thermal provides 100% hot water in summer and 70% in winter. PV panels generate 90% of electricity. Bioclimatic design reduces demand by 65% before renewables. Ground-source heat pump supplements winter heating.</p>
