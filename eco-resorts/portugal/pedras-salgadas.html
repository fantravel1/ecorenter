          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Where Architecture Floats and Springs Rise</h2>

          <p>Tras-os-Montes -- "beyond the mountains" -- is Portugal's most remote and least-visited region, a landscape of chestnut forests, granite villages, and thermal springs that has changed little in centuries. The mineral springs of Pedras Salgadas have been valued since Roman times, and the bottled water brand bearing the name has been a household staple in Portugal since 1871. When the Unicer group decided to create an eco-resort on the historic spring site, they chose not to build a conventional spa hotel but to create something that would set a new benchmark for minimal-impact architecture in sensitive natural environments.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Architect Luis Rebelo de Andrade's solution was ingenious: modular structures, prefabricated off-site from sustainable materials, craned into the forest canopy on steel pilotis, and connected by elevated walkways. Not a single tree was felled. The houses appear to float among the oaks, their dark wood cladding echoing the bark of the surrounding trees. Each unit is entirely self-contained and could, in theory, be removed without leaving a permanent mark on the forest floor. This reversibility principle -- the idea that human presence should be temporary and removable -- is central to the project's philosophy.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Energy: Geothermal Deep Roots</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The same geological forces that produce Pedras Salgadas' mineral springs also provide its heating and cooling. A geothermal ground-source heat pump system taps the earth's consistent subsurface temperature to heat the Eco Houses in winter and cool them in summer. The system's coefficient of performance (COP) averages 4.2, meaning it produces 4.2 units of thermal energy for every unit of electricity consumed. This provides approximately 92% of heating and cooling needs, with the remaining 8% supplemented by the national grid during peak demand. Solar photovoltaic panels on the spa building generate additional renewable electricity. The modular construction's high insulation values -- FSC-certified wood walls with recycled insulation -- minimize heat loss, further reducing energy demand. The spa facilities benefit from the naturally heated spring water, which arrives at a consistent temperature requiring minimal additional energy input.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Water: Ancient Springs, Modern Stewardship</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Pedras Salgadas sits above one of Portugal's most significant aquifer systems. The naturally carbonated mineral water, rich in bicarbonates and silicates, emerges from over 100 meters depth. This spring water serves as the resort's primary drinking water, eliminating the need for treated municipal supply. The national geological authority monitors extraction rates to ensure sustainability, and the resort's withdrawal represents a fraction of the spring's natural flow. For non-drinking purposes, the resort combines rainwater harvesting with a greywater treatment system. Low-flow fixtures throughout reduce consumption, and the spa's mineral water pools operate on a recirculation system that minimizes waste. The resort publishes annual water balance data showing extraction, consumption, and return rates.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Biodiversity: The Living Forest</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The 20-hectare oak forest is placed under a conservation management plan developed in partnership with the Portuguese Institute for Nature Conservation (ICNF). The forest is a mature Quercus robur woodland -- increasingly rare in a country where eucalyptus monoculture has displaced native forest on an enormous scale. Annual biodiversity surveys monitor bird populations, insect diversity, and oak regeneration. Over 2,000 native oak saplings have been planted in degraded areas at the forest edge, gradually expanding the woodland. Invasive species -- particularly eucalyptus seedlings and Acacia dealbata -- are systematically removed. The forest supports populations of red squirrel, European jay, nuthatch, great spotted woodpecker, and over 70 other bird species.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Architecture: Design as Ethics</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The Eco Houses represent a philosophy of architecture as environmental ethics. Every design decision was filtered through a sustainability lens. The modular prefabrication approach reduced construction waste by an estimated 60% compared to conventional on-site building. FSC-certified larch cladding weathers naturally without chemical treatment. Steel pilotis transfer building loads to specific points, minimizing soil compaction and maintaining root zone integrity. Elevated walkways allow water, wildlife, and leaf litter to flow naturally beneath the structures. The ArchDaily Building of the Year award recognized not just the design's aesthetic achievement but its demonstration that luxury accommodation and ecological sensitivity can be designed simultaneously from the first sketch.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Regional Impact</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">In economically depressed Tras-os-Montes, the resort provides significant employment and economic stimulus. Over 60 staff are drawn from surrounding villages. The resort sources food from local producers wherever possible, supporting small-scale agriculture in a region where farming is declining. Partnerships with local chestnut, olive, and wine producers have created new market channels for traditional products. The resort also supports a cultural program that celebrates the region's distinctive traditions, including pauliteiros dance performances, traditional textile workshops, and seasonal food festivals that draw visitors into the wider community.</p>

          <p>No resort is perfect. Here is what we document alongside the strengths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Remote Access:</strong> Tras-os-Montes is over 4 hours from Porto by car, and there is no public transport to the resort. Guest transport emissions are significant.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Corporate Ownership:</strong> Unlike community-owned properties, Pedras Salgadas is owned by a large beverage corporation. While sustainability commitments are genuine, corporate priorities could theoretically shift.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Grid Dependency for Electricity:</strong> While heating/cooling is predominantly geothermal, electrical power still comes primarily from the national grid. Solar PV covers only a portion of electricity needs.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Seasonal Extremes:</strong> Northern Portugal's cold winters increase energy demand significantly. Geothermal performance is consistent but supplementary heating is needed during the coldest weeks.</p>
