A solar PV system covers approximately 60% of electricity needs, with grid backup for the remainder. Water comes from a borehole and is supplemented by rainwater harvesting. Greywater from showers is filtered through reed beds and reused for irrigation. Composting toilets eliminate flush water consumption."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How close is Monte Velho to the beach?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Monte Velho is located near Carvalhal, approximately 3 kilometers from the Alentejo coastline. Praia do Carvalhal and Praia da Galé are the nearest beaches, reachable by bicycle or a short drive. The coastline is part of the Vicentine Coast Natural Park, with dramatic cliffs, wild dunes, and relatively uncrowded beaches."}}]}

          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Where Wellness Meets Wildness</h2>

          <p>The Alentejo coast is one of the last unspoiled stretches of European shoreline. Unlike the overdeveloped Algarve to the south, this coastline remains largely protected within the Vicentine Coast Natural Park, with dramatic cliffs, empty beaches, and a hinterland of cork oak forests, Mediterranean scrubland, and traditional farming communities. Monte Velho sits in this landscape near the village of Carvalhal, about 3 kilometers from the coast, on a property that transitions from cultivated organic gardens to wild nature reserve.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The retreat was founded by a Portuguese-Dutch couple who wanted to create a space where wellness practices and ecological living were inseparable. Too many wellness retreats, they observed, offered yoga and meditation in settings that were environmentally destructive: energy-intensive spa buildings, imported organic products, chemically treated pools. Monte Velho was designed so that every element of the guest experience, from the composting toilets to the outdoor showers to the plant-based meals, would reinforce the connection between personal wellbeing and planetary health.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Eco-Cabins: Built From the Land</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The retreat's cabins are constructed using locally sourced pine and cork, with cork insulation providing excellent thermal regulation in both summer heat and winter chill. Walls are lime-washed using traditional Alentejo techniques, and roofs are terracotta tile. Foundations use minimal concrete with recycled aggregate. Each cabin features natural cross-ventilation and shading from deciduous trees that block summer sun while admitting winter light. Composting toilets eliminate flush water consumption entirely, with the composted material enriching the gardens after a two-year cycle. Outdoor showers drain into planted reed beds that filter greywater for garden irrigation. The result is accommodation that consumes approximately 70% less water and 40% less energy than a conventional hotel room of comparable size.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Yoga and Mindful Living</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The open-air yoga shala is the retreat's centerpiece: a wooden platform with a canvas shade structure that opens to views across the nature reserve. Daily classes are offered in Hatha, Vinyasa, Yin, and restorative yoga, suitable for beginners through advanced practitioners. Weekly retreats guided by resident and visiting teachers combine asana practice with meditation, breathwork, sound healing, and nature immersion. But yoga is woven into the entire experience rather than confined to the shala. Morning meditation happens at dawn in the garden. Walking meditation follows trails through the reserve. Evening practices take place under the stars. The retreat's philosophy holds that mindfulness practiced only on a yoga mat is incomplete; it must extend to how we eat, consume, and relate to the natural world.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Organic Gardens and Kitchen</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The retreat's organic garden supplies vegetables, herbs, and fruits to the kitchen using no-dig, mulch-based growing methods. Beds are organized in a mandala pattern that combines aesthetic beauty with practical companion planting principles. A small orchard provides seasonal stone fruits, citrus, and figs. The kitchen prepares predominantly plant-based meals with occasional eggs from the retreat's free-range chickens. All cooking uses local, seasonal ingredients, and guests are invited to participate in harvesting, preparation, and bread baking. Food waste is composted on-site or fed to the chickens, creating a closed-loop system where waste from the kitchen returns to the garden as fertility.</p>

        <div class="section-header"><span class="section-label">Honest Assessment</span><h2 id="tradeoffs-heading">Trade-offs and Limitations</h2></div>
        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Composting Toilets:</strong> Not everyone is comfortable with composting toilets. While well-maintained and odor-free, they require a different approach than conventional flush systems. Guests who find this challenging may prefer other properties.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Limited Amenities:</strong> Monte Velho deliberately avoids luxury amenities. There is no pool, spa, television, or air conditioning. WiFi is available only in common areas. This minimalism is intentional but will not suit all travelers.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Partial Energy Independence:</strong> Solar PV covers approximately 60% of electricity needs. The remaining 40% comes from the Portuguese grid, which still includes fossil fuel sources. Full solar independence is a goal but not yet achieved.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Rural Isolation:</strong> The retreat's peaceful setting means limited restaurant options, no nightlife, and car dependency for exploring the region. Public transport connections are minimal.</p>
