          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Where the Forest Speaks First</h2>

          <p>Treetops Lodge sits within 800 hectares of native podocarp and broadleaf forest in the volcanic heartland of New Zealand's North Island. This is not a hotel with a garden. It is a conservation estate that happens to have guest rooms. The forest contains ancient rimu, totara, and matai trees -- some over 800 years old -- alongside volcanic hot springs, seven trout streams, and a regenerating ecosystem that is slowly being freed from the introduced predators that have devastated New Zealand's native wildlife.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The lodge draws its heating from the same geothermal energy that powers Rotorua's famous hot springs. Underground thermal reservoirs provide consistent, zero-emission warmth through heat pump systems. No gas boilers. No oil furnaces. The Earth itself heats your room while you sleep, as it has heated this volcanic plateau for millennia.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Predator-Free Sanctuary: Protecting Kiwi and Kereru</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">New Zealand's native birds evolved without mammalian predators. When humans introduced rats, stoats, and possums, the results were catastrophic. Treetops Lodge runs an intensive predator control network across its entire 800-hectare estate. Hundreds of trap lines are monitored by dedicated conservation staff. The results are measurable: native bird counts have increased significantly since the program began. Kiwi calls are heard at night. Kereru (native wood pigeons) feed in the canopy. Tui and bellbird song fills the dawn chorus. This is not brochure copy -- it is documented in annual bird surveys conducted in partnership with the Department of Conservation.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Trout Conservation: Seven Streams, One Mission</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The lodge's estate includes seven spring-fed streams that sustain wild populations of rainbow and brown trout. While trout are introduced species in New Zealand, these waterways represent important recreational fisheries that Treetops manages through rigorous conservation protocols. Riparian planting programs stabilize banks and shade water to maintain optimal temperatures. Water quality is monitored monthly. All fishing is catch-and-release under the guidance of qualified guides. The stream health program serves as a proxy indicator for the broader watershed health of the region.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Maori Cultural Partnership: Kaitiakitanga in Practice</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Treetops Lodge operates in partnership with local Ngati Whakaue iwi, the traditional guardians (kaitiaki) of this land. Maori cultural programs are not performances for tourists -- they are genuine knowledge exchanges led by iwi members who share their ancestral relationship with the forest, the geothermal landscape, and the native species. Rongoaa (traditional plant medicine) walks teach guests about the pharmacological knowledge embedded in indigenous botanical traditions. Revenue from cultural programs flows directly to the iwi, supporting language revitalization and youth education programs.</p>

          <p>No resort is perfect. Here is what we document alongside the strengths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Flight Emissions:</strong> New Zealand is remote. Most international guests arrive via long-haul flights with significant carbon footprints. The lodge does not currently offer carbon offset programs, though geothermal heating reduces on-site emissions substantially.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Trout as Introduced Species:</strong> While the trout conservation program maintains healthy waterways, trout are themselves an introduced species that compete with native freshwater species. This ecological tension is acknowledged but not fully resolved.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Price Point:</strong> Treetops Lodge is a luxury property with rates that place it beyond most travelers' budgets. The conservation model depends on high-value, low-volume tourism, but this limits who can experience and learn from the property's work.</p>
