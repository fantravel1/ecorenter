          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Where the Mountains Meet the Whales</h2>

          <p>Kaikoura is a place of geological drama. The Seaward Kaikoura Range rises over 2,600 meters directly behind the town, while offshore, the continental shelf plunges into a submarine canyon deeper than the Grand Canyon. This dramatic convergence of mountain and ocean creates one of the most nutrient-rich marine environments on Earth -- and it is this convergence that makes Hapuku Lodge's location so remarkable.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The Wilson family has farmed this land for generations, raising deer on the coastal plains between mountains and sea. When they built tree houses in the native kanuka grove, they were not creating a novelty. They were extending a farming family's deep understanding of the land into a hospitality experience that keeps guests viscerally connected to the ecosystems around them. From the tree house decks, you watch the dawn light catch the snow on the peaks while sperm whales surface in the deep waters below.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Farm-to-Table: From the Ground Up</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The organic garden is not an amenity -- it is the foundation of the kitchen. Seasonal vegetables, herbs, and salad greens grow year-round in the mild coastal climate. The deer farm provides free-range venison processed on-site with minimal food miles. Olive trees produce house-pressed olive oil. Lavender fields yield essential oils for the lodge's own products. What cannot be grown on the property is sourced from neighboring farms and the Kaikoura fishing fleet, keeping the supply chain within a 50-kilometer radius wherever possible.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Native Planting: 10,000 Trees and Counting</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Over the past decade, the Wilsons have planted more than 10,000 native trees across the property. Kowhai, flax, cabbage trees, and native grasses recreate the coastal vegetation that once covered this landscape. The planting creates habitat corridors connecting fragmented native forest patches, allowing tui, bellbirds, and kereru to move safely across the property. A predator trapping program protects these returning birds from rats, stoats, and possums -- the introduced predators that devastate New Zealand's native species.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Whale Watch Partnerships</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Hapuku Lodge partners with Whale Watch Kaikoura, the pioneering Maori-owned ecotourism enterprise that has become a global model for indigenous marine tourism. Founded in 1987 by the Ngai Tahu iwi, Whale Watch transformed Kaikoura from a struggling fishing town into one of the world's premier wildlife destinations. The partnership channels tourism revenue directly into marine research, conservation, and Maori community development. Guests can arrange whale watching, dolphin swimming, and albatross encounters through the lodge.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Post-Earthquake Resilience</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The 2016 Kaikoura earthquake -- magnitude 7.8 -- devastated the region's infrastructure, raising the seabed by up to two meters and severing road access for months. Hapuku Lodge rebuilt and reopened, and the earthquake actually improved whale watching conditions by bringing the submarine canyon closer to shore. The lodge's recovery demonstrated the resilience of small-scale, community-connected tourism businesses and reinforced the importance of local supply chains when national infrastructure fails.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Deer Farming Questions:</strong> While the deer are free-range and humanely managed, deer farming itself has environmental impacts including methane emissions and land use. The lodge is transparent about this tension between agricultural heritage and ecological ideals.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Energy Tracking:</strong> The lodge does not currently publish detailed energy consumption data. While it benefits from New Zealand's renewable grid, on-site renewable generation is limited. Solar or micro-hydro installation would strengthen the energy profile.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Access Carbon:</strong> Kaikoura is a 2.5-hour drive from Christchurch. Most guests arrive by car, contributing road transport emissions. The TranzCoastal scenic train provides a lower-carbon alternative but has limited frequency.</p>

                <p>Over 10,000 native trees have been planted including kowhai, flax, cabbage trees, and native grasses. The planting creates habitat corridors for tui, bellbirds, and kereru. A predator trapping program protects these species from introduced rats and stoats.</p>

                <p>Sperm whales are resident year-round. Winter (June-August) offers humpback migration and fewer tourists. Summer (December-February) has the warmest weather but highest demand. The 2016 earthquake improved conditions by bringing whales closer to shore.</p>
