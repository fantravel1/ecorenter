          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Where Farming and Conservation Share the Same Fence Line</h2>

          <p>Wharekauhau sits where the Rimutaka Range descends to Palliser Bay -- one of the North Island's most exposed and dramatic coastlines. For over a century, this land has been farmed. Romney sheep graze the coastal paddocks, Angus cattle work the higher ground, and the rhythms of lambing, shearing, and mustering define the estate's calendar. But over the past two decades, Wharekauhau has been quietly demonstrating that productive farming and ecological restoration are not competing land uses.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The estate's name comes from te reo Maori -- "whare" (house) and "kauhau" (to address or speak). For the Rangitane iwi who hold mana whenua (territorial authority) over this land, the coastline and surrounding hills are part of a cultural landscape stretching back centuries. The estate maintains an ongoing relationship with local iwi, consulting on matters of cultural significance and incorporating Maori perspectives into conservation planning.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Wetland Restoration: 50 Hectares Reclaimed</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">New Zealand has lost over 90% of its wetlands since European settlement. Wharekauhau has reversed this trend on its own land, restoring more than 50 hectares of degraded wetland to functioning ecosystem. Native flax, raupo, and cabbage trees now filter agricultural runoff before it reaches Palliser Bay. The restored wetlands provide breeding habitat for pukeko, grey duck, and paradise shelduck, and act as carbon sinks that partially offset the estate's agricultural emissions. The restoration was designed in partnership with Greater Wellington Regional Council and follows best-practice protocols.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Native Bush Corridors</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Between the paddocks, Wharekauhau has planted native bush corridors connecting fragmented forest patches. These corridors allow birds, insects, and lizards to move between habitat areas safely. The planting focuses on species that once dominated the Wairarapa coast: kowhai, broadleaf, totara, and native grasses. Over 15,000 native plants have been established across the property, creating a mosaic of farmland and native ecosystem that supports both agricultural productivity and biodiversity.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Predator Control: The 200-Trap Network</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Over 200 predator traps stretch across the estate and into the Rimutaka Range foothills. The trap line targets rats, stoats, and possums -- the three species responsible for the majority of native bird deaths in New Zealand. Monthly trap data is reported to DOC as part of the national Predator-Free 2050 program. Since the trapping program intensified, staff and guests have documented measurable increases in tui, bellbird, and kereru populations on the property. Morepork (native owl) calls, once rare, are now regular at night.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Farm-to-Table: Zero Food Miles</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The estate kitchen operates on a simple principle: cook what the land provides. Romney lamb, Angus beef, seasonal vegetables from the kitchen garden, herbs from the herb spiral, and free-range eggs walk a few hundred meters from source to plate. Palliser Bay provides crayfish and paua (abalone) when available. Wairarapa wines from vineyards within 30 kilometers complete the experience. The head chef plans seasonal menus in direct consultation with the farm manager, ensuring that what appears on the plate reflects what the land is currently producing.</p>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Agricultural Emissions:</strong> Sheep and cattle farming produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. While wetland restoration and native planting partially offset these emissions, the estate has not published a complete carbon accounting that includes agricultural methane. This is a significant gap in the sustainability profile.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Energy Profile:</strong> The estate does not currently generate on-site renewable energy beyond what the national grid provides. Solar, wind, or micro-hydro installation would strengthen the energy profile significantly given the property's size and location.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Luxury Pricing:</strong> Wharekauhau is a luxury property with premium rates that limit accessibility. The conservation and community benefits are genuine but the experience is available only to affluent travelers.</p>
