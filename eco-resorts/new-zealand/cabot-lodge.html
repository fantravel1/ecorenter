          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Architecture That Vanishes</h2>

          <p>PurePods began with a radical question: what if accommodation could leave absolutely no trace? Not reduced-impact. Not low-footprint. Zero. The answer is a glass pod that sits on adjustable steel legs placed directly on the ground surface. No concrete foundations. No trenches for water pipes. No sewage connections. No power lines. When a PurePod is removed, the land beneath it is indistinguishable from the surrounding landscape. This is not aspirational marketing -- it is an engineering specification that can be independently verified by anyone who inspects the pod's connection (or rather, non-connection) to the earth beneath it.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Each pod is a glass-walled structure positioned in a location of exceptional natural beauty across Canterbury's mountains, coastlines, and high country stations. The glass walls are the point -- guests sleep, cook, and live inside the landscape rather than separated from it. Stars above. Tussock below. Mountains all around. The pod shelters you from wind and rain while refusing to insulate you from the reality of where you are.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Composting: Closing the Loop</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The composting toilet is the most visible symbol of PurePods' zero-footprint philosophy. Each pod uses a self-contained system where sawdust or coconut coir replaces water for flushing. Aerobic decomposition breaks down waste into safe compost that is periodically collected and used in the native grassland restoration program. No water is consumed. No sewage is produced. No infrastructure is required. The system closes the nutrient loop entirely -- what enters the pod as food leaves as compost that feeds the native plants being restored around it.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Native Grassland Restoration</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Canterbury's native tussock grasslands have been largely replaced by European pasture grasses for farming. PurePods partners with private landowners to restore native red tussock, snow tussock, and associated native herbs on farming land adjacent to pod sites. Revenue from bookings provides the financial incentive for farmers to convert conventional pasture back to native grassland. Each pod location has a specific restoration plan developed with ecologists, creating a direct economic link between tourism and ecosystem recovery.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Solar Independence</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Each pod operates on a small solar panel and battery system that powers LED lighting, USB charging, and essential amenities. A gas cooktop and small heater provide cooking and warmth without electrical connection. The energy system is deliberately minimal -- there is enough power to be comfortable but not enough to forget where you are. This constraint is intentional. PurePods is not a hotel experience delivered in a glass box; it is an encounter with landscape enabled by just enough technology to make it safe.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Comfort Limitations:</strong> PurePods are closer to luxury camping than hotel accommodation. Winter nights can be cold despite the gas heater. There is no shower. No hot running water. Guests who expect hotel amenities will be disappointed.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Car Access Required:</strong> Most PurePod locations require driving on rural roads, meaning guests arrive by private vehicle with associated emissions. No public transport options exist for most pod locations.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Gas Dependency:</strong> While electricity is solar, cooking and heating rely on bottled gas -- a fossil fuel. The overall carbon footprint per night is very low but not zero due to this gas usage.</p>
