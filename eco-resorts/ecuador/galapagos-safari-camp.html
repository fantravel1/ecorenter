          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Glamping Where Darwin Walked</h2>

          <p>The Galapagos Islands changed how humanity understands life on Earth. They also face an existential crisis: invasive species, overtourism, and the carbon footprint of reaching one of the most remote archipelagos on the planet. Galapagos Safari Camp was designed to address every one of these tensions. Situated in the lush highlands of Santa Cruz rather than the crowded waterfront of Puerto Ayora, the camp offers safari-style tented accommodation powered entirely by the equatorial sun.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">What makes this property extraordinary is its location within the giant tortoise migration corridor. These are not zoo animals behind fences. Wild Galapagos giant tortoises -- the same species that helped Darwin formulate natural selection -- walk freely through the camp grounds, grazing on native grasses as they have for millennia. The camp's fencing is designed to never impede their movement. Staff track individual tortoises by shell markings and report data to the Charles Darwin Research Station, contributing to long-term population monitoring.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Solar Power: Off the Diesel Grid</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The Galapagos historically ran on diesel generators shipped from the mainland at enormous cost and environmental risk. Fuel spills have damaged marine ecosystems. Galapagos Safari Camp broke from this dependency entirely. A comprehensive solar array with lithium battery storage provides 100% of electricity needs. Hot water, kitchen equipment, lighting, and guest amenities all run on sunlight. The system was engineered for equatorial conditions, producing consistent output year-round with minimal seasonal variation. A backup generator exists for emergencies but activation logs show it runs fewer than 20 hours per year.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Invasive Species: Undoing Centuries of Damage</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Invasive blackberry, guava, and elephant grass have colonized vast areas of the Galapagos highlands, smothering native Scalesia and Miconia forests that exist nowhere else on Earth. The camp runs systematic removal programs on its property and surrounding areas. Staff and volunteers spend hundreds of hours annually pulling invasive plants by hand and replacing them with native species propagated in the camp's nursery. The camp also supports island-wide rat eradication programs that protect nesting seabirds and native reptiles from predation.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Local Food: Reducing the Carbon of Every Meal</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Every food item that arrives in the Galapagos by cargo ship carries an enormous carbon footprint. The camp's 2,000-square-meter organic garden produces approximately 40% of fresh kitchen needs on-site. Remaining produce comes from partnerships with local Santa Cruz highland farmers rather than mainland imports. These direct purchasing agreements provide farmers with stable income, incentivize sustainable agriculture, and dramatically reduce the food miles associated with feeding guests in one of the world's most remote destinations.</p>

          <p>No resort is perfect. Here is what we document alongside the strengths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Flight Carbon:</strong> Reaching the Galapagos requires a flight from mainland Ecuador. There is no low-carbon alternative. The archipelago's remoteness is both its ecological treasure and its tourism carbon liability. The camp does not currently purchase verified carbon offsets for guest flights.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Water Scarcity:</strong> The Galapagos face chronic freshwater scarcity. While the highland location benefits from more rainfall than coastal areas, water remains a constrained resource. Conservation measures reduce but do not eliminate the camp's water footprint.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Limited Capacity Impact:</strong> With only nine luxury tents, the camp's direct conservation impact is proportional to its small size. The invasive species removal and tortoise monitoring programs are meaningful but represent a fraction of what the islands require.</p>
