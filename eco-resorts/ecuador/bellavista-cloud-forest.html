          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">A Dome in the Clouds</h2>

          <p>The Choco bioregion is one of the most biodiverse places on the planet and one of the most devastated. Over 90% of its original forest cover has been cleared for cattle ranching and agriculture. What remains exists in fragments -- islands of extraordinary life surrounded by pasture. Bellavista Cloud Forest Reserve was born from the decision to protect one of those fragments and, through reforestation, to start connecting them again.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The lodge itself is an architectural statement: geodesic domes built from sustainable materials, positioned at 2,200 meters elevation where clouds engulf the forest daily. The dome geometry achieves maximum interior space with minimum materials, sheds torrential rainfall efficiently, and creates naturally ventilated rooms that need no air conditioning or heating. Large triangular windows frame the forest canopy where hummingbirds, tanagers, and toucans are constant visitors. The architecture says: you can build beautifully in a fragile ecosystem without destroying it.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Hummingbird Research: Jewels Under Study</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Over 30 hummingbird species have been documented on the reserve. The research program bands individuals, tracks populations across seasons, and studies the pollination relationships between hummingbirds and the cloud forest's extraordinary orchid and bromeliad diversity. Species highlights include the Booted Racket-tail with its distinctive leg puffs, the iridescent Violet-tailed Sylph, the massive Empress Brilliant, and the rare Purple-bibbed Whitetip. Feeders near the lodge allow close observation, but the real research happens in the forest where natural foraging behavior reveals the ecological web these birds maintain.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Reforestation: 30,000 Trees and Counting</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The reforestation program has planted over 30,000 native trees on formerly degraded cattle pasture within the reserve. The nursery propagates endemic species -- Cedrela, Podocarpus, and various Lauraceae -- that form the backbone of cloud forest ecology. Planting follows ecological restoration principles: species are mixed to recreate the multi-layered forest structure rather than creating monoculture plantations. Annual survival monitoring ensures resources target areas with highest success rates. The program has reconnected previously isolated forest fragments, creating corridors that allow birds, mammals, and amphibians to move between habitat patches.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community: The School in the Valley</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The Tandayapa Valley community had limited access to quality education before ecotourism arrived. Bellavista contributes to the local school's operating costs, funding teacher salaries and educational materials. The lodge runs environmental education programs that bring children to the reserve for guided walks, bird identification workshops, and hands-on ecology lessons. The goal is to raise a generation that understands the economic and ecological value of the cloud forest they live beside -- children who see the forest as an asset to protect rather than an obstacle to clear.</p>

          <p><strong>Why Tier B:</strong> Bellavista demonstrates strong conservation outcomes but lacks the third-party certification and independently audited data that distinguish Tier A properties. Reforestation numbers are self-reported. Community impact metrics would benefit from external verification. The property earns Tier B based on visible conservation results and operational transparency.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Conservation Evidence:</strong> Bird species list verified through eBird submissions and published checklists. Hummingbird banding data shared with ornithological networks. Reforestation planting records maintained but not independently audited.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Community Evidence:</strong> School support documented through partnership agreements. Employment records show local hiring priority. Environmental education program participation tracked by student numbers.</p>
