          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">The Community That Chose Parrots Over Petroleum</h2>

          <p>The Anangu Kichwa community's 53,000-hectare territory sits atop significant petroleum reserves. Oil companies offered extraction deals that would have brought immediate cash. The community made a different choice: they would protect their forest and build an economy on showing it to the world. Napo Wildlife Center was the result -- a lodge designed, built, and operated entirely by the community, funded initially by international conservation grants and now fully self-sustaining through tourism revenue.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">This is not a partnership where an outside company employs indigenous people. The Anangu community owns 100% of the operation. Major decisions go through community assembly. The general manager is a community member. The guides are Kichwa men and women whose ecological knowledge comes from lifetimes lived in this forest. When guests arrive by hand-paddled canoe and step onto the dock, they are entering a community's home -- and that community has chosen, deliberately and at significant economic cost, to keep it standing.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Energy: Solar in the Rainforest</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Every unit of electricity at Napo Wildlife Center comes from solar panels. No generators run within the community territory. No fossil fuels power the lodge operations. This is remarkable for a remote Amazon location where generator power is the default. The solar system, expanded in phases, now provides reliable electricity for lighting, water pumping, kitchen equipment, and guest amenities. Battery storage covers nighttime needs. The lodge was designed to minimize energy demand: natural ventilation replaces air conditioning, strategic architecture captures light without heat, and LED lighting reduces consumption throughout.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Water: Rainforest Purity</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The lodge draws water from a pristine blackwater creek system within the community territory. Natural filtration through the forest root system produces clean source water that requires minimal treatment. A UV purification system provides safe drinking water without chemicals. Greywater is treated through a series of settling ponds and constructed wetlands before returning to the forest system. The community monitors water quality in the creek system as an indicator of overall ecosystem health -- any degradation would signal problems far beyond the lodge's operations.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community: Every Dollar Stays</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Revenue from the lodge funds a community scholarship program that has sent dozens of young Kichwa people to university. It maintains a community health center with trained health workers. It funds infrastructure including clean water systems for the village. It supports cultural preservation programs for language, traditional medicine, and craft traditions. And critically, it funds territorial monitoring -- community rangers who patrol the 53,000-hectare territory against illegal logging, hunting, and oil exploration incursion. The community has demonstrated that sustainable tourism can provide an economic alternative to resource extraction.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Biodiversity: 600 Species of Birds in One Territory</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Over 600 bird species have been documented within the community territory. This number alone would make it one of the premier birding destinations on Earth, but the territory also harbors 10 species of primates, giant otters, black caimans, pink river dolphins, anacondas, and an estimated 100,000+ insect species. The parrot clay licks are among the most spectacular wildlife phenomena in the Americas -- at dawn, hundreds of parrots and macaws descend to exposed clay banks to consume mineral-rich soil. A 36-meter observation tower provides canopy-level viewing of species that spend their entire lives above the forest floor.</p>

          <p>No resort is perfect. Here is what we document alongside the strengths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Access Carbon Footprint:</strong> Reaching Napo Wildlife Center requires a flight from Quito to Coca followed by a motorized boat ride on the Napo River. The domestic flight and motorized river transport generate significant carbon emissions that are not offset by the lodge's on-site zero-fossil-fuel operations.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Waste Management Challenges:</strong> Remote Amazon location makes comprehensive recycling difficult. While the lodge manages organic waste through composting, recyclable materials must be transported long distances to processing facilities. Waste diversion rates are lower than urban-accessible eco-resorts.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Internet Connectivity:</strong> Satellite internet is available but slow and unreliable. This is not a destination for digital nomads requiring consistent connectivity. The lodge frames this as a feature rather than a bug -- disconnection from devices enhances the nature experience.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Capacity Pressure:</strong> The lodge's success has increased visitor numbers, creating tension between revenue generation and the low-impact experience that defines the property. The community continues to evaluate optimal visitor limits.</p>

                <p>The Anangu Kichwa community owns and operates 100% of the lodge. All major decisions go through community assembly. Revenue funds education, healthcare, infrastructure, and territorial defense. Community members serve as guides, staff, and management. There are no external investors or corporate partners. The community chose tourism over oil extraction despite their territory sitting atop significant petroleum reserves.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>At dawn, hundreds of parrots, parakeets, and macaws gather at exposed clay riverbanks to consume mineral-rich soil that neutralizes toxins in their fruit-heavy diet. The largest lick attracts up to 11 species simultaneously, creating one of the most extraordinary wildlife spectacles in the Americas. Observation blinds at safe distances allow viewing without disturbance.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>All transport from the Napo River to the lodge is by hand-paddled canoe. No motorized boats operate within community territory. This eliminates noise pollution, fuel spills, wake erosion, and wildlife disturbance. The two-hour canoe journey through pristine flooded forest is itself a wildlife experience where monkeys, caimans, and giant otters are regularly observed.</p>
