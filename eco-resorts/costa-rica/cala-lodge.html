          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Where Canopy Meets Coast</h2>

          <p>Dominical was once a sleepy surfer village, known only to those willing to navigate rutted dirt roads for the reward of uncrowded waves. As development pressure mounted along Costa Rica's southern Pacific coast in the 2010s, a small group of conservation-minded investors saw an opportunity not to build another beachfront resort, but to create something fundamentally different. Cala Lodge was designed from the ground up to demonstrate that boutique hospitality could thrive while actively strengthening the surrounding community and ecosystem.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Set on a forested hillside overlooking the Pacific, Cala Lodge's eight treehouse suites are nestled into the canopy rather than imposed upon it. Not a single mature tree was felled during construction. Instead, the architecture wraps around trunks and branches, creating spaces that feel like extensions of the forest itself. From every suite, guests look out through leafy frames to the ocean beyond -- a daily reminder that the boundary between built environment and natural world need not exist.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Energy: Solar Canopy Design</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Cala Lodge's solar system was designed as an integral part of the architecture rather than an afterthought. Photovoltaic panels are integrated into the roofing of each treehouse and the main lodge building, generating approximately 85% of total energy needs. A centralized lithium-ion battery bank provides overnight storage and cloudy-day redundancy. The remaining energy comes from a small grid connection used primarily as backup. The lodge's passive cooling strategy -- cross-ventilation corridors, elevated platforms, strategic canopy shade -- means that air conditioning has never been installed. Average energy consumption per guest night is estimated at less than half that of a conventional beach resort in the region.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Water: Hillside Stewardship</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Perched on a hillside, Cala Lodge uses gravity-fed rainwater collection supplemented by a permitted spring water source. Low-flow fixtures and aerated showerheads reduce consumption without compromising guest comfort. Greywater from showers and sinks passes through a biofilter system planted with native heliconias and gingers before being used for garden irrigation. Blackwater is treated in a septic system with an advanced leach field designed to prevent any contamination of downhill waterways. The lodge monitors water quality in the stream below the property quarterly.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community: Artisan Economy</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">What sets Cala Lodge apart is its deep investment in the local artisan economy. Every piece of furniture, every textile, every decorative element was crafted by artisans from the Dominical-Uvita corridor. The lodge maintains ongoing relationships with 14 artisan cooperatives, providing guaranteed purchase commitments that give artisans the financial stability to invest in their craft. A weekly artisan market held at the lodge introduces guests to traditional techniques -- woodcarving, textile dyeing, pottery, basket weaving -- and provides an additional direct sales channel. The lodge estimates that its artisan partnerships inject over $120,000 annually into the local creative economy, supporting approximately 45 families.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Farm-to-Table: The 15-Kilometer Kitchen</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The lodge's 2-acre organic farm operates on permaculture principles, producing tropical fruits, vegetables, culinary herbs, and edible flowers. Head gardener Maria Elena, a Dominical native, manages the farm with a team of two using zero synthetic inputs. What the farm cannot supply -- protein, dairy, grains -- comes from organic producers within a 15-kilometer radius. Eight local farming families hold standing supply agreements with the lodge, providing income stability that has allowed several to transition from conventional to organic methods. The kitchen composts all food waste, returning nutrients to the farm in a closed loop that produces zero organic waste destined for landfill.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Biodiversity: Forest Corridor Protection</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The lodge's 12-hectare property sits within a critical biological corridor connecting coastal mangroves to upland forest. Rather than clearing for views, the lodge maintains over 90% forest cover, providing habitat for white-faced capuchins, scarlet macaws, coatis, and over 180 recorded bird species. A reforestation project on previously degraded pastureland at the property's edge has planted over 3,000 native trees since 2018, gradually expanding the corridor width. The lodge participates in the national bird monitoring program and hosts visiting researchers from the Organization for Tropical Studies.</p>

          <p>No resort is perfect. Here is what we document alongside the strengths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Grid Dependency:</strong> While 85% solar, the lodge still relies on grid electricity for approximately 15% of its energy needs. Full off-grid transition is planned but not yet achieved.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Small Scale Limitations:</strong> With only eight suites, Cala Lodge's per-guest infrastructure cost is higher than larger resorts. This translates to room rates that exclude budget travelers.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Seasonal Water Stress:</strong> During the dry season (December-April), rainwater collection is insufficient and the lodge relies more heavily on its spring water source, which faces competing demand from surrounding development.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Limited Accessibility:</strong> The hillside treehouse design, while minimizing forest impact, presents accessibility challenges for guests with mobility limitations. Only the main lodge building is wheelchair accessible.</p>
