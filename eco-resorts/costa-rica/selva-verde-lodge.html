          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Four Decades of Forest Defense</h2>

          <p>When Selva Verde Lodge opened its doors in 1982, the concept of "eco-tourism" barely existed. Costa Rica's Sarapiqui lowlands were being cleared at an alarming rate for cattle ranching and banana plantations. The lodge's founders made a bet that would take decades to validate: that tourists would travel to the Caribbean lowlands not for beaches, but for the chance to walk through one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. They were right.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Today, Selva Verde's 500-acre reserve stands as an island of old-growth and secondary rainforest surrounded by agricultural land. The property functions as a critical corridor connecting to Braulio Carrillo National Park, allowing wildlife to move between protected areas. In a region where over 60% of original forest cover has been lost, this corridor is not a luxury -- it is a lifeline for hundreds of species.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Energy: River Power Without Dams</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Selva Verde's micro-hydroelectric system is a run-of-river design that harnesses the Sarapiqui River's flow without impoundment. No dam, no reservoir, no disruption to fish migration or river ecology. The system generates approximately 90% of the lodge's electricity needs year-round, taking advantage of the region's 4,000mm annual rainfall that keeps the river flowing consistently. A supplementary solar array covers the remaining energy needs. The lodge's architectural design, with open-air common areas and natural ventilation corridors, keeps energy demand low by eliminating the need for air conditioning in most spaces.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Water: Tropical Abundance, Careful Management</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">In one of the wettest regions on Earth, water supply is not the challenge -- water quality protection is. Selva Verde operates a comprehensive wastewater treatment system that ensures no untreated water enters the Sarapiqui River. Greywater passes through a series of biofilters and constructed wetlands before being used for landscaping irrigation. The lodge uses phosphate-free cleaning products and biodegradable toiletries exclusively. Rainwater is collected for non-potable uses, reducing demand on the municipal water supply by an estimated 35%.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Biodiversity: 50,000 Trees and Counting</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The crown achievement of Selva Verde's environmental program is its reforestation initiative. Over four decades, the lodge has planted more than 50,000 native trees on previously deforested land within and adjacent to its reserve. Each tree is GPS-tagged, species-documented, and monitored for survival and growth. The reforestation has increased canopy cover in degraded areas by over 40%, creating new habitat for wildlife and expanding the effective size of the biological corridor. Species planted include almendro trees -- a critical food source for the endangered great green macaw -- as well as ceiba, guanacaste, and dozens of other native species selected for their ecological function.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Research: The Living Laboratory</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Selva Verde's partnership with the Sarapiqui Conservation Learning Center has made the property one of the most studied tropical sites outside of formal research stations. Over 200 peer-reviewed papers have cited research conducted on the property. The lodge provides subsidized accommodation for visiting researchers, maintains long-term monitoring plots for plant phenology and bird populations, and hosts university field courses from institutions across North America and Europe. This research creates a feedback loop: scientific findings inform management decisions, which improve habitat quality, which attracts more researchers.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community: Roots in Sarapiqui</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Over 80% of Selva Verde's 65-person staff are from the Sarapiqui district. The lodge operates educational programs for local schools, bringing over 1,000 students annually through the reserve for guided natural history lessons. A scholarship fund supports higher education for employees' children. The lodge sources food from local producers where possible and provides a market for small-scale organic farmers who might otherwise struggle to compete with large agricultural operations.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Aging Infrastructure:</strong> As one of the oldest ecolodges in Costa Rica, some facilities show their age. Ongoing renovations are updating systems, but the process is gradual to maintain operations.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Agricultural Surroundings:</strong> The reserve is bordered by banana and pineapple plantations that use conventional agriculture methods. Pesticide drift and runoff from neighboring properties remain ongoing concerns that the lodge cannot fully control.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Humidity Challenges:</strong> The lowland tropical climate means high humidity year-round. While this is essential for the rainforest ecosystem, it presents maintenance challenges and may not suit all travelers' comfort preferences.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Limited Off-Grid Capability:</strong> While the hydroelectric system provides most energy, the lodge remains connected to the grid for backup and cannot operate fully independently during extended droughts that reduce river flow.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Selva Verde uses a run-of-river micro-hydroelectric system that harnesses the Sarapiqui River's flow without requiring a dam. The system generates approximately 90% of the lodge's electricity with no impact on river ecology or fish migration. Solar panels supplement the remaining energy needs.</p>

                <p>Over four decades, Selva Verde has planted more than 50,000 native trees across previously deforested land. Each tree is GPS-tagged and monitored. The reforestation has increased canopy cover by over 40% in restored areas, focusing on species like almendro trees that support endangered wildlife.</p>
