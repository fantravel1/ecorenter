          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">A Thousand Acres of Living Proof</h2>

          <p>In the early 1990s, John and Karen Lewis arrived on Costa Rica's Osa Peninsula with a vision that many thought was naive: build a luxury lodge that would fund the protection of 1,000 acres of primary rainforest while employing local communities at fair wages. Three decades later, Lapa Rios Ecolodge stands as one of the world's most compelling arguments that ecotourism can work -- really work -- when sustainability is embedded in every decision, not painted on as an afterthought.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The Osa Peninsula is not a gentle place. National Geographic called it "the most biologically intense place on Earth," and that intensity cuts both ways. The peninsula harbors 2.5% of global biodiversity within just 0.001% of the planet's surface area, but it also faces relentless pressure from gold mining, logging, and land clearing. Lapa Rios was born as a direct response to these threats -- a demonstration that standing forest could be worth more than felled trees.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Energy: 100% Solar, Zero Compromise</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Every watt of electricity consumed at Lapa Rios comes from its solar array. The system, expanded in 2021, includes battery storage sufficient to maintain full operations through cloudy periods and nights. A micro-hydro system from a nearby stream provides backup redundancy. The lodge was architecturally designed with passive cooling -- open-air construction, strategic ventilation corridors, elevated platforms that catch breezes -- so air conditioning is unnecessary. This is not a sacrifice in comfort; it is superior design that makes mechanical cooling irrelevant.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Water: Rainforest Stewardship</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">On a peninsula that receives 200+ inches of rainfall annually, water is abundant but its treatment is critical. Lapa Rios operates a gravity-fed spring water system, eliminating the need for electric pumps. All greywater passes through a constructed wetland treatment system that uses native plants to filter and purify before return to the ecosystem. Low-flow fixtures throughout the lodge reduce consumption by an estimated 45% compared to conventional resorts. Guests drink spring water from glass bottles, eliminating the need for purification chemicals or plastic.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Waste: The Zero Plastic Journey</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">In 2019, Lapa Rios completed its transition to zero single-use plastics. The elimination was systematic: water bottles replaced with glass, toiletries moved to refillable dispensers with locally made organic products, food packaging negotiated with suppliers to eliminate plastic at the source. Organic waste feeds a large-scale composting system that returns nutrients to the lodge's gardens. Recyclables are sorted on-site and transported to Puerto Jimenez for processing. The lodge estimates it diverts over 85% of its waste stream from landfill.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community: 300 People, One Purpose</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Over 95% of Lapa Rios staff come from surrounding Osa Peninsula communities. The lodge provides above-market wages, comprehensive health insurance, and ongoing education programs. It has funded improvements to three local schools, sponsors a scholarship program for university-bound students, and operates a community health initiative. An estimated 300 community members benefit directly or indirectly from the lodge's operations. Former poachers and loggers have become naturalist guides -- the lodge's most prestigious and well-paid positions.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Biodiversity: The 1,000-Acre Shield</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The lodge's 1,000-acre private reserve acts as a critical biological corridor connecting to Corcovado National Park. This corridor allows scarlet macaws, tapirs, peccaries, four monkey species, and hundreds of bird species to move between protected areas. The lodge employs dedicated rangers who patrol the reserve, monitor wildlife populations with camera traps, and participate in national biodiversity surveys. Since Lapa Rios began operating, wildlife populations in the surrounding area have measurably increased -- a direct, documented impact of the lodge's forest protection.</p>

          <p>No resort is perfect. Here is what we document alongside the strengths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Access Carbon Footprint:</strong> The Osa Peninsula is remote. Most guests fly into San Jose and then take a domestic flight to Puerto Jimenez or a long drive. The travel carbon footprint to reach Lapa Rios is significant and not offset by the lodge's on-site practices. The lodge does not currently offer carbon offset programs for guest travel.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Price Accessibility:</strong> Lapa Rios is a luxury property with rates that place it beyond the reach of budget travelers. While the premium funds conservation and community programs, it raises questions about equitable access to ecotourism experiences.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Internet Connectivity:</strong> The remote location means internet connectivity is limited and unreliable. This is not ideal for digital nomads who need consistent connectivity, though it does reduce the lodge's technology-related energy demands.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Food Miles:</strong> While the organic garden supplements kitchen needs, the majority of food supplies must be transported from the Central Valley or other agricultural regions, adding food-mile emissions to the supply chain.</p>

                <p>Over 95% of Lapa Rios staff are hired from surrounding communities on the Osa Peninsula. The lodge provides above-market wages, health insurance, ongoing education programs, and has funded local school improvements. An estimated 300 community members benefit directly or indirectly. Former poachers and loggers have been retrained as naturalist guides -- the lodge's most prestigious positions.</p>

                <p>Since 2019, Lapa Rios has completely eliminated single-use plastics.

The lodge worked with every supplier to eliminate plastic packaging at the source.</p>
