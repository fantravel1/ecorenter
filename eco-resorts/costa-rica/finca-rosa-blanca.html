          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Where Coffee Meets Carbon Neutrality</h2>

          <p>Nestled in the volcanic highlands above Heredia, Finca Rosa Blanca began as a simple idea: what if a coffee farm could be both a world-class accommodation and a living laboratory for sustainable agriculture? Over two decades, that idea has grown into one of Central America's most respected ecolodges, a place where guests wake to the scent of organic coffee blossoms and fall asleep knowing their stay has a net-zero carbon impact.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The 30-acre estate sits at 4,500 feet elevation, overlooking the Central Valley with views stretching to both the Pacific and the Caribbean on clear days. The main building is a piece of organic architecture inspired by Gaudi -- all curves and flowing forms, no right angles. It was designed to work with the landscape rather than imposing upon it, and that philosophy extends to every aspect of operations.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Energy: The Carbon Neutral Journey</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Finca Rosa Blanca achieves carbon neutrality through a layered approach. Rooftop solar panels generate roughly 65% of electricity needs. Coffee processing waste produces biogas that powers kitchen operations and heating. The property's 30+ acres of reforested shade trees act as a significant carbon sink, absorbing CO2 as they grow. For the remaining emissions -- primarily from guest transportation and supply chain -- the lodge purchases verified carbon offsets from Costa Rica's national reforestation program. This is transparent: the carbon audit is published annually, and offset purchases are documented.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Water: Highland Conservation</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">At 4,500 feet in a cloud forest zone, water management takes on particular importance. The lodge operates a rainwater collection system that supplements spring water for non-potable uses. Coffee processing -- traditionally one of agriculture's most water-intensive operations -- uses a modern ecological wet mill that reduces water consumption by 80% compared to conventional methods. All wastewater passes through a biodigester and constructed wetland before returning to the watershed.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Waste: From Pulp to Compost</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Coffee production generates enormous quantities of organic waste -- cherry pulp, mucilage, and parchment. At Finca Rosa Blanca, 100% of this waste is composted and returned to the farm as fertilizer, closing the nutrient loop. Kitchen waste follows the same path. The lodge has eliminated single-use plastics from guest areas, uses only biodegradable cleaning products, and maintains an aggressive recycling program. The waste diversion rate exceeds 90%.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community: Beyond Employment</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The lodge employs 85% of its staff from the surrounding Santa Barbara and Heredia communities. But the community relationship extends beyond paychecks. Finca Rosa Blanca pays premium prices to local organic suppliers, sponsors environmental education programs in three nearby schools, funds a community health clinic, and has established a scholarship fund for local students pursuing studies in sustainable agriculture or environmental science. The coffee farm itself provides seasonal employment and training in organic methods that workers can apply to their own small holdings.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Biodiversity: Shade-Grown Shelter</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Unlike industrial sun-grown coffee that requires forest clearing, Finca Rosa Blanca cultivates shade-grown coffee under a diverse canopy of native trees. This approach creates habitat for over 200 bird species documented on the property, including resplendent quetzals, various toucans, and dozens of migratory species. The reforested areas connect to a larger biological corridor, and the lodge participates in national bird monitoring programs. The property also maintains beehives to support pollinator populations and produces its own honey.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Carbon Offset Reliance:</strong> While on-site renewable energy covers 65% of needs, achieving full carbon neutrality requires purchased offsets. The quality and additionality of these offsets, while verified, remains an area where the industry standard is debated.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Scale Limitations:</strong> As a boutique property with only 14 rooms, Finca Rosa Blanca's per-guest environmental investment is significant but its total community impact is proportionally smaller than larger operations.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Central Valley Location:</strong> The highland location means less direct biodiversity impact compared to properties adjacent to primary forest or national parks. The shade-grown approach is valuable but the surrounding area is more agricultural than wild.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Seasonal Water Stress:</strong> During the dry season (December-April), the region experiences water stress. While the lodge manages its own consumption responsibly, it operates within a watershed that faces broader allocation challenges.</p>
