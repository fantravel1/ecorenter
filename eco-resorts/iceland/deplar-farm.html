          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">From Sheep Farm to Sustainability Pioneer</h2>

          <p>The Fljot valley on Iceland's Troll Peninsula was losing its people. Like many rural areas in North Iceland, young generations were leaving for Reykjavik and Akureyri, and the farms that had sustained families for centuries were falling silent. Deplar Farm had been a working sheep operation for generations when Eleven Experience acquired it and began a transformation that would bring life back to the valley -- not through agriculture, but through responsible adventure tourism.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The conversion preserved the original farmhouse structure and stone walls, incorporating them into a modern lodge design that references the agricultural vernacular of Icelandic farming. The result is a 13-suite property that feels rooted in its landscape rather than imposed upon it. The building sits where sheep once sheltered from North Atlantic storms, and the geothermal water that now fills the infinity pool is the same resource that Icelandic farmers have used for centuries to warm their homes and greenhouses.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Energy: The Valley's Underground Heat</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Deplar Farm's geothermal borehole draws hot water from the same volcanic system that heats much of North Iceland. The water emerges at roughly 70 degrees Celsius and feeds the lodge's heating system, domestic hot water supply, and the spectacular infinity pool that extends from the lodge's lower level toward the surrounding mountains. Electricity comes from Iceland's 100% renewable grid, supplemented by a connection to the Dalvik municipal geothermal utility. Total fossil fuel consumption for heating and electricity is zero.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community: Reversing Rural Decline</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The lodge employs approximately 35 staff year-round, with the majority drawn from the Fljot valley and the fishing town of Dalvik, 30 minutes away. In a region where a single employer can determine whether a community survives, Deplar Farm has become an economic anchor. The lodge purchases lamb from valley farmers, fish from Dalvik fishermen, and dairy from regional producers. Staff receive above-market wages and year-round employment -- a rarity in seasonal tourism. Local families that might have left have stayed, and the valley's elementary school remains open partly because lodge employees have children enrolled there.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Adventure: The Heli-Skiing Question</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Deplar Farm is renowned for its heli-skiing program, accessing untouched powder on the Troll Peninsula's volcanic peaks. This is the most environmentally contentious aspect of the operation, and we document it transparently. Helicopter use is inherently carbon-intensive. The lodge mitigates impact through strict flight protocols: routes avoid nesting bird areas and wildlife corridors, operations are limited to optimal conditions to minimize unnecessary flights, group sizes are maximized to reduce per-person carbon cost, and all flights are offset through verified carbon programs. The lodge publishes its annual flight hours and offset methodology. Whether this mitigation is sufficient is a judgment we leave to each traveler.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Food: Valley to Table</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The kitchen operates on a valley-to-table philosophy. Free-range Icelandic lamb -- the heritage breed that has roamed Iceland's mountains since the Norse settlement -- comes from farms in the same valley. Arctic char and Atlantic salmon are sourced from local rivers and the Eyjafjordur coast. Dairy arrives from Akureyri-area producers. Vegetables come from geothermal greenhouses in Dalvik that grow tomatoes, cucumbers, and herbs year-round using volcanic heat. Foraged Arctic thyme, crowberries, bilberries, and angelica appear seasonally on the menu. Approximately 70% of food ingredients originate within 100 kilometers of the lodge.</p>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Heli-Skiing Carbon Impact:</strong> Despite offsets and mitigation, helicopter-based skiing has an inherently high carbon footprint. The offset approach reduces but does not eliminate this environmental cost.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Remote Access:</strong> Reaching the Troll Peninsula requires either a domestic flight to Akureyri plus a drive, or a 5-hour drive from Reykjavik. Travel emissions to reach the property are substantial.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Ultra-Luxury Pricing:</strong> Deplar Farm operates as an exclusive-use property with rates that place it among the most expensive accommodations in Iceland. The community benefits are significant, but the model serves a narrow demographic.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Seasonal Wildlife Sensitivity:</strong> Winter heli-skiing occurs during a period when some local bird species are beginning pre-nesting behavior. Although flight paths avoid known nesting areas, cumulative noise impacts are difficult to measure precisely.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" role="region"><div class="faq-answer-inner"><p>Approximately 70% of food is sourced within 100 kilometers: free-range Icelandic lamb from valley farms, wild Arctic char and salmon from local rivers, dairy from regional producers, and vegetables from geothermal greenhouses in Dalvik. Foraged Arctic thyme, crowberries, and angelica supplement seasonal menus.</p></div></div>

            <div class="faq-answer" role="region"><div class="faq-answer-inner"><p>The lodge employs approximately 35 year-round staff, mostly from surrounding communities. It purchases supplies from local businesses, supports the local school, and has helped reverse population decline in the Fljot valley. Without the lodge, several local services would likely have closed due to insufficient demand. Staff receive above-market wages and year-round employment.</p></div></div>
