The KivuWatt project extracts this methane from deep lake water, processes it, and uses it to generate electricity. This simultaneously produces clean energy and reduces the risk of a natural disaster. The hotel draws power from Rwanda's national grid, which is increasingly supplied by KivuWatt methane generation. The energy is not zero-emission, but it converts a dangerous greenhouse gas into useful electricity while preventing potential catastrophe."

          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Energy From the Lake That Could Explode</h2>

          <p>Lake Kivu sits on a geological time bomb. Dissolved in its deep waters are approximately 60 billion cubic meters of methane and 300 billion cubic meters of carbon dioxide -- gases that accumulate from volcanic activity beneath the lake floor. If a volcanic event or earthquake disturbed the lake's stratified layers, these gases could erupt in a limnic eruption, releasing a suffocating cloud of CO2 that could kill millions of people living around the lake's shores. It happened at Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986, killing 1,746 people.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Rwanda's response to this existential threat is ingenious: extract the methane and burn it for electricity. The KivuWatt project pumps deep lake water to the surface, where dissolved methane separates and is captured for power generation. Lake Kivu Serena draws power from Rwanda's national grid, increasingly supplied by this methane extraction. The hotel's energy is not zero-emission -- methane combustion produces CO2 -- but it converts a dangerous greenhouse gas into useful electricity while reducing the risk of a catastrophic natural disaster. This is sustainability measured not in carbon neutrality but in disaster prevention.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Fishing Partnerships: Lake to Plate</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Lake Kivu supports a traditional fishing industry centered on isambaza, a sardine-like fish that forms the dietary protein staple for lakeside communities. The hotel partners directly with fishing cooperatives, paying fair prices and bypassing middlemen who traditionally capture much of the value. The hotel has invested in improved equipment and sustainable fishing techniques for its partner cooperatives. Guests can visit the fishing villages, join dawn fishing expeditions, and trace their dinner from the lake to their plate.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Organic Gardens and Water Stewardship</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The hotel's organic gardens produce herbs, vegetables, and fruits for the kitchen, with composting systems converting food waste into garden fertilizer. Water conservation is taken seriously despite the lakeside location: low-flow fixtures, greywater recycling for irrigation, and rainwater harvesting for non-potable uses. Lake water is treated on-site rather than drawing from municipal supply, and all wastewater is treated before any potential discharge. The hotel tracks water consumption per guest night as a key metric.</p>
