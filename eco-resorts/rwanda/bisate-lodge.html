          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Growing a Forest From a Vision</h2>

          <p>When Wilderness Safaris chose the site for Bisate Lodge, they did not pick pristine forest. They chose degraded farmland on the edge of Volcanoes National Park -- a landscape stripped of its indigenous vegetation by decades of subsistence agriculture. The vision was audacious: build a luxury lodge and simultaneously reforest the surrounding land, creating an expanding corridor of montane forest that would connect to the national park and extend available habitat for mountain gorillas.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">That vision is now measurable reality. Over 70,000 indigenous trees have been planted across the property and surrounding community land. Hagenia, Dombeya, Neoboutonia, and other native species are maturing into a genuine montane forest. Camera trap surveys show golden monkeys, bushbuck, and forest birds colonizing the restored habitat. The trees are not decorative -- they are creating a functional ecosystem where one had been destroyed.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Architecture: Royal Heritage Meets Forest Restoration</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Bisate's six forest villas draw their design from the curved, woven aesthetic of the traditional Rwandan royal palace at Nyanza. Each villa is a cocoon of organic forms -- curved walls, woven screens, layered thatch -- designed to harmonize with the surrounding landscape. As the reforestation program matures, the villas are gradually being enveloped by growing forest, fulfilling the design intention of architecture that disappears into nature rather than dominating it. The interiors are luxurious but restrained, using local materials, handwoven textiles, and community-crafted furnishings.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Reforestation: 70,000 Trees and Counting</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The reforestation program is Bisate's defining sustainability achievement. The lodge operates its own nursery growing indigenous montane forest species from locally collected seeds. Community members are employed as nursery workers, planters, and forest monitors. Survival rates are tracked for every planting cohort. The program extends beyond the lodge property into surrounding community land, creating a landscape-scale restoration initiative. The long-term goal is to create a continuous forest corridor from the lodge to the national park boundary, expanding the effective habitat available to gorillas and other wildlife.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community: Artisans, Not Employees</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Bisate's community program goes beyond conventional employment. The artisan program trains over 100 community members -- predominantly women -- in traditional weaving, pottery, and textile arts. Products are sold at the lodge and through Wilderness Safaris' retail network. The Gorilla Guardians Village program partners with former poachers who now serve as conservation ambassadors, sharing their knowledge of the forest with guests while earning dignified incomes. This is not charity. It is an economic model that makes conservation the most profitable land use for communities living alongside the park.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Gorilla Conservation: Beyond the Permit</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">While the $1,500 gorilla trekking permit funds national conservation efforts, Bisate contributes additional support through direct partnerships with the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. Lodge revenue funds research positions, veterinary interventions for injured gorillas, and population monitoring. The lodge's reforestation program is itself a conservation intervention -- every tree planted increases the forest available to gorilla families who range across the Virunga volcanic slopes. Guests can visit the Gorilla Guardians Village, meet researchers, and participate in tree planting to understand the full scope of conservation effort that makes their gorilla encounter possible.</p>

          <h2 id="tradeoffs-heading">Trade-offs and Limitations</h2>
          <p>No resort is perfect. Here is what we document alongside the strengths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Price Accessibility:</strong> Bisate is among Rwanda's most expensive lodges, with rates exceeding $2,000 per night. Combined with the $1,500 gorilla permit, the total cost places the experience beyond most travelers' budgets. While the premium funds significant conservation, it raises questions about who benefits from ecotourism experiences.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Energy Mix:</strong> While Bisate uses solar panels and energy-efficient design, the lodge is not 100% off-grid. Generator backup is required during extended cloudy periods. The energy score reflects this honest reality rather than aspirational claims.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Supply Chain:</strong> Many luxury amenities and specialty food items are imported from Kigali or beyond, adding food-mile emissions. The kitchen garden supplements but does not replace sourced ingredients.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Small Scale:</strong> With only six villas, Bisate's direct economic impact on the surrounding community, while meaningful per guest, is limited by its small size. The artisan program extends impact beyond lodge employment, but the model's scalability to larger properties is unproven.</p>

                <p>Bisate's six forest villas are inspired by the traditional Rwandan royal palace architecture. The curved, woven structures echo the aesthetic of the King's palace at Nyanza while using modern sustainable construction techniques. Each villa is designed to eventually disappear into the landscape as the reforestation program's trees mature around them.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Bisate contributes through three channels: the reforestation program expands available gorilla habitat, a portion of lodge revenue funds Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund research and monitoring, and the community artisan program provides alternative livelihoods that reduce pressure on forest resources. The lodge also supports the Gorilla Guardians Village program for former poachers.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>The community artisan program trains over 100 community members -- predominantly women -- in traditional weaving, pottery, and textile arts. Products are sold at the lodge and through Wilderness Safaris retail channels. The program provides dignified income while preserving cultural heritage and creating economic alternatives to subsistence farming on park-adjacent land.</p>
