          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Where Luxury Becomes a Conservation Tool</h2>

          <p>One&amp;Only Gorilla's Nest occupies a 130-acre estate at the foot of the Virunga volcanic massif, the mountain range that straddles Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The property sits within a mixed forest of eucalyptus plantation and regenerating indigenous species -- a transitional landscape between human settlement and the montane forests of Volcanoes National Park where mountain gorillas range.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The lodge's approach to sustainability is systematic rather than performative. Carbon neutrality is achieved through measured reduction (solar power, insulation, efficient systems) combined with verified offsets for residual emissions. The native tree nursery does not just provide carbon sequestration numbers -- it produces the specific species needed to convert the property's eucalyptus plantation into indigenous Albertine Rift forest, the habitat type mountain gorillas actually need. Community investment is not philanthropic marketing -- it is a structured economic program that makes conservation the most rational livelihood choice for neighboring families.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Carbon Neutral: Measured and Verified</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The lodge's carbon neutral status is built on three pillars. First, on-site solar panels generate a substantial portion of electricity needs, supplemented by Rwanda's national grid which itself draws significantly from renewable hydroelectric sources. Second, the buildings are designed with natural insulation, passive solar heating, and energy-efficient systems that reduce demand. Third, an annual carbon audit quantifies residual emissions -- primarily from generator backup, imported supplies, and staff transport -- which are offset through verified programs. The nursery's tree planting provides additional carbon sequestration measured independently from the offset purchases.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">The Tree Nursery: Engineering a Forest Transition</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The on-site nursery produces approximately 5,000 native seedlings annually. Species are carefully selected to match the indigenous montane forest composition: Hagenia abyssinica for its rapid growth and nitrogen fixation, Podocarpus for long-term canopy structure, Prunus africana for its ecological value, and understory species that create the layered habitat structure gorillas prefer. The nursery is managed by trained community members and serves as both a production facility and an educational resource. Guests can participate in planting sessions, gaining a tactile understanding of the reforestation effort that surrounds their experience.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community Schools: Education as Conservation</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The lodge's school support program goes beyond funding. Infrastructure improvements including classrooms, water supply, and sanitation facilities are complemented by teacher training partnerships and scholarship funds for exceptional students. The logic is straightforward: educated communities make better conservation decisions. When young people can envision careers beyond subsistence farming on park margins, the pressure on gorilla habitat decreases. The program currently supports a local primary school serving over 400 students, with plans to extend support to secondary education.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Craft Training: Preserving Culture, Creating Income</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The craft training center teaches traditional Rwandan basket weaving (agaseke), beadwork, and woodcarving techniques to community members. Products are sold at the lodge gift shop and through international distribution channels. The program employs approximately 50 artisans, with income significantly exceeding what subsistence agriculture provides. This is not a tourist performance -- it is a genuine economic program that preserves endangered cultural skills while creating sustainable livelihoods.</p>

          <p>No resort is perfect. Here is what we document alongside the strengths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Eucalyptus Legacy:</strong> Much of the property's forest is non-native eucalyptus plantation. The native tree nursery is converting this gradually, but full ecological restoration will take decades. The current landscape provides limited habitat value compared to indigenous forest.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Luxury Supply Chain:</strong> As an ultra-luxury property, many specialty ingredients, wines, and amenities are imported, adding supply chain emissions that the carbon offset program addresses but does not eliminate at source.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Water Intensity:</strong> Luxury amenities including laundry, spa, and swimming pool create higher per-guest water consumption than simpler eco-lodges. Water conservation measures are in place but the baseline demand remains elevated.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Offset Reliance:</strong> Achieving carbon neutrality partly through offset purchases rather than purely operational reduction means the claim depends on the quality and permanence of offset projects, which vary in effectiveness.</p>
