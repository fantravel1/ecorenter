          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">The Park That Came Back From the Dead</h2>

          <p>By 2010, Akagera National Park was a shadow of its former self. The park had lost 60% of its land to post-genocide resettlement. Lions had been poisoned to extinction. The last rhino had been poached. Wildlife populations were decimated. Tourism revenue was negligible. The park was heading toward being de-gazetted -- converted from conservation to agricultural use. Then African Parks took over management, and one of the most remarkable conservation recoveries in African history began.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Today, Akagera is a Big Five national park. Lions brought from South Africa in 2015 and 2017 have established breeding prides. Eastern black rhinos -- among the most endangered subspecies on Earth -- were translocated in 2017 and 2019. Poaching has dropped by over 95%. Tourism revenue now covers over 75% of park management costs. Magashi Camp, opened by Wilderness Safaris in 2019, represents the flagship of this recovery -- a luxury camp on the shores of Lake Rwanyakazinga that turns safari tourism into conservation funding.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Anti-Poaching Technology: Smart Conservation</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Akagera's anti-poaching system is among the most sophisticated in Africa. An electric perimeter fence surrounds the entire park, preventing human-wildlife conflict and unauthorized entry. Every rhino carries a GPS transmitter monitored in a 24/7 operations center. Camera trap networks cover key areas. Drones provide aerial patrol support. Predictive analytics software identifies poaching risk hotspots based on historical data and environmental conditions. A rapid-response ranger unit can deploy to any point in the park within minutes. This technology is funded by tourism revenue -- every night a guest spends at Magashi Camp contributes to the digital shield protecting these animals.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community Revenue Sharing: Making Conservation Pay</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">The communities surrounding Akagera were historically in conflict with the park -- wildlife raided crops, and the park provided no tangible benefit. The revenue sharing model changed this equation. A percentage of every park entry fee and concession payment flows directly to surrounding villages, funding schools, health clinics, clean water projects, and agricultural support. Magashi Camp employs local community members and sources supplies from nearby villages. The result is measurable: human-wildlife conflict incidents have dropped dramatically as communities see economic benefit from the park's success.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Lake Rwanyakazinga: Safari on the Water</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Magashi Camp sits on the shores of Lake Rwanyakazinga, Akagera's largest lake and home to one of Africa's highest concentrations of hippos. Boat safaris offer perspectives impossible in traditional vehicle-based game drives: eye-level encounters with hippo pods, African fish eagles fishing from shoreline trees, and Nile crocodiles basking on mudflats. The lake ecosystem is a critical component of Akagera's recovery, supporting fish-eating birds, otters, and the sitatunga antelope that inhabits the papyrus marshes.</p>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Reintroduction Risks:</strong> Translocating large predators and rhinos is inherently risky and ethically complex. Some translocated animals have died during or after the process, though overall success rates have been high.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Price Accessibility:</strong> Magashi Camp is ultra-luxury priced, limiting access to high-budget travelers. The conservation funding model depends on premium pricing that excludes most potential visitors.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Generator Dependency:</strong> Despite solar primary power, a diesel generator is required for backup and peak demand periods. Full renewable operation is not yet achieved.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Land Conflict History:</strong> The park's reduction in size displaced communities post-genocide. While current community programs address this, the historical context of land allocation remains complex and sensitive.</p>
