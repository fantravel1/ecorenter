          <span class="section-label">The Story</span>
          <h2 id="story-heading" style="font-size:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Living in the Canopy of Earth's Oldest Rainforest</h2>

          <p>Khao Sok's rainforest is 160 million years old -- predating the Amazon by more than 100 million years. During the last ice age, when much of the planet's vegetation was buried under glaciers, this forest survived as a biological refuge. Today it harbors species found nowhere else, with a density of life that astonishes even seasoned tropical ecologists. Our Jungle House exists within this living cathedral not as a luxury intrusion but as a careful integration, placing guests into the canopy itself through a collection of treehouses that rise among the ancient trees on locally built wooden platforms.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Founded by a Thai-European couple who wanted to prove that rainforest tourism could directly benefit both wildlife and local communities, Our Jungle House operates on a simple principle: the forest is the attraction, so protect the forest. The treehouses are built from sustainably sourced wood and bamboo by local craftsmen. The kitchen serves food grown in the surrounding area. The guides who lead rainforest treks, night safaris, and river trips are from neighboring villages. Every baht spent here circulates through the local economy.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Energy: Solar in the Canopy</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">A solar panel array generates roughly 65% of the property's electricity. The treehouse design inherently minimizes energy demand -- there is no air conditioning, and the open construction at canopy level ensures constant natural ventilation. LED lighting powered by solar batteries illuminates pathways at night with warm, low-intensity light that minimizes disruption to nocturnal wildlife. Solar water heaters provide hot showers. Cooking uses locally sourced charcoal and LPG. The remaining electricity comes from the provincial grid, and plans are underway to increase solar capacity to cover 80% of needs.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Water: Rainforest Abundance</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Khao Sok receives over 3,500mm of rainfall annually -- among the highest in Thailand. Our Jungle House harvests rainwater through collection systems on service buildings, filtering it for guest showers and kitchen use. Natural spring water supplements during dry months. Greywater from the kitchen and bathrooms passes through a gravel and plant filtration system before being released into the landscape. Low-flow fixtures in all treehouses keep consumption modest. Water use per guest is estimated at 60% below standard hotel benchmarks.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Waste: Jungle Challenges</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">All organic kitchen waste is composted and used in the property garden. Recyclable materials are sorted and transported to collection points in Surat Thani, though the remote location creates logistical challenges for recycling. Single-use plastics have been reduced significantly, with refillable water bottles provided to guests. The waste diversion rate is improving but acknowledged as a work-in-progress -- remote rainforest locations lack the recycling infrastructure available in urban settings.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Community: 95% Local Operation</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Nearly every person at Our Jungle House is from surrounding Surat Thani communities. Kitchen staff, housekeeping, construction, and guides are all local. The lodge pays above-market wages and provides meals and housing for staff who travel from distant villages. Guide training programs develop specialist knowledge of the rainforest ecosystem, creating skilled conservation employment. A portion of guest fees funds village education initiatives and supports local healthcare access.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Biodiversity: The Wildlife Corridor</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Our Jungle House occupies a critical position at the edge of Khao Sok National Park, within a wildlife corridor that connects the park to surrounding forest blocks. The property maintains strict no-development zones that preserve continuous forest cover for gibbons, langurs, civets, and dozens of other species to move between habitats. Elevated treehouses avoid blocking ground-level animal paths. Night lighting is designed to minimize disturbance to nocturnal wildlife. The lodge supports anti-poaching patrols and reports any illegal activity to park authorities. Camera trap surveys document wildlife movement across the property.</p>

          <h2 id="tradeoffs-heading">Trade-offs and Limitations</h2>
          <p>No resort is perfect. Here is what we document alongside the strengths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p><strong>Basic Facilities:</strong> Our Jungle House is a genuine treehouse experience, not a luxury resort. Bathrooms are basic, hot water is solar-dependent, and there is no air conditioning. This authenticity is a strength for many guests but may disappoint those expecting five-star comfort.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Waste Infrastructure Gap:</strong> Remote rainforest location means limited recycling infrastructure. While organic waste is composted, other recyclables face long transport distances to processing facilities. The waste diversion rate is below what urban eco-resorts achieve.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>No Formal Certification:</strong> The property has not pursued international eco-certification, limiting independent verification of some claims. While practices are strong, the absence of third-party auditing keeps the evidence tier at B.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem;"><strong>Access Impact:</strong> Remote location requires road transfers of 2-3 hours from the nearest airports. The access carbon footprint is significant, though once on-site the environmental impact per guest is minimal.</p>

                <p>Treehouses are elevated 4-20 meters above the forest floor, built from local hardwood and bamboo. Comfortable bedding, mosquito netting, basic bathroom, private terrace with rainforest views. Higher treehouses offer direct canopy views of gibbons and hornbills. No AC -- natural ventilation.</p>

                <p>The property sits in a critical wildlife corridor. No-development zones preserve forest continuity for gibbons, langurs, and civets. Elevated construction avoids disrupting animal paths. Minimal night lighting protects nocturnal species. Anti-poaching patrols are supported.</p>
