        <p class="hero-subtitle">The travel industry spends billions telling you it is sustainable. We spend our time verifying whether that is true. These guides give you the knowledge to tell the difference between genuine eco-practices and marketing theater.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="intro-heading">
      <div class="container container--narrow">
        <h2 id="intro-heading">Why These Guides Exist</h2>
        <p>The word "sustainable" has been stretched so thin it is almost meaningless. Hotels install a towel reuse sign and call themselves eco-friendly. Resorts plant three trees and claim carbon neutrality. Airlines sell offsets for flights that pump tons of CO2 into the atmosphere and call it guilt-free travel.</p>
        <p>We built these guides because travelers deserve better than marketing slogans. Each guide is based on peer-reviewed research, industry audits, verified operational data from our database of 2,000+ eco-resorts, and on-the-ground reporting. We name what works, what does not, and what is simply theater designed to make you feel good while changing nothing.</p>

        <h3>What Real Sustainability Looks Like</h3>
        <p>Real sustainability in eco-tourism is measurable, verifiable, and transparent. It means a resort can tell you exactly how many kilowatt-hours of renewable energy it generated last year. It means local employees earn living wages, not just minimum wage. It means waste reduction targets are published and tracked, not just mentioned in brochures.</p>
        <p>Real sustainability also means acknowledging trade-offs. No resort is perfect. An off-grid jungle lodge with excellent solar panels might still rely on diesel generators for backup. A community-owned ecolodge might not yet have the budget for advanced water treatment. Honest sustainability reporting includes these gaps alongside the achievements.</p>

        <h3>How Greenwashing Works</h3>
        <p>Greenwashing exploits the gap between consumer desire for sustainability and the complexity of actually achieving it. It works through several common tactics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vague language:</strong> Terms like "eco-friendly," "green," and "natural" have no regulated definition in most countries. Any resort can use them without proving anything.</li>
          <li><strong>Irrelevant claims:</strong> Highlighting one small initiative (towel reuse, bamboo straws) while ignoring major impacts (diesel generators, imported food, underpaid staff).</li>
          <li><strong>Hidden trade-offs:</strong> Promoting one green feature while concealing environmental costs elsewhere. A "solar-powered" resort that runs air conditioning units 24/7 is not what it appears.</li>
          <li><strong>Fake certifications:</strong> Self-awarded labels, paid-for badges from unrecognized bodies, or expired certifications still displayed on websites.</li>
          <li><strong>Offset theater:</strong> Claiming carbon neutrality through offsets of questionable quality while making no effort to reduce actual emissions.</li>
        </ul>

          <h2 id="evidence-heading">The EcoRenter Evidence System</h2>
          <p>Every claim we publish is backed by evidence. Here is exactly how our verification system works.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="philosophy-grid">
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Tier A: Certified and Audited</h3>
            <p>The highest evidence tier. Requires third-party certification from a GSTC-recognized body (Rainforest Alliance, Green Globe, EarthCheck, or equivalent) plus independent operational audits conducted within the past 24 months. Only about 15% of resorts in our database achieve Tier A status.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Tier B: Documented Operations</h3>
            <p>Resorts that publish transparent, verifiable operational data. This includes energy generation and consumption records, water usage reports, waste audits, community employment statistics, and financial contributions to conservation. Approximately 35% of our listings hold Tier B evidence.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Tier C: Community Verified</h3>
            <p>Evidence gathered from verified travelers, local community members, and environmental NGOs with on-the-ground presence. We cross-reference multiple independent sources before accepting Tier C evidence. About 45% of our listings are primarily Tier C verified.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Tier D: Never Published</h3>
            <p>Resorts that fail verification, refuse to provide data, or present evidence of misleading claims are never listed on EcoRenter. No amount of marketing budget, partnership offers, or advertising revenue can override a Tier D classification. About 5% of reviewed resorts fall into this category.</p>

          <span class="section-label">Impact Measurement</span>
          <h2 id="scoring-heading">How We Score Sustainability Impact</h2>
          <p>Our five-dimension impact scoring system provides a transparent, comparable measure of each resort's sustainability performance.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Five Dimensions</h3>
        <p>Every listed resort receives a score from 0 to 100 across each dimension. These scores are based on verified evidence, weighted by evidence tier (Tier A evidence carries more weight than Tier C), and updated annually.</p>

        <div class="impact-summary">
          <div class="impact-item">
            <div class="impact-item-icon" aria-hidden="true">&#9889;</div>

            <div class="impact-item-label">Conservation, harvesting, treatment, recycling, per-guest consumption</div>
          </div>
          <div class="impact-item">
            <div class="impact-item-icon" aria-hidden="true">&#9851;</div>
            <div class="impact-item-value">Waste</div>
            <div class="impact-item-label">Reduction, composting, recycling rates, plastic elimination, landfill diversion</div>
          </div>
          <div class="impact-item">
            <div class="impact-item-icon" aria-hidden="true">&#129309;</div>
            <div class="impact-item-value">Community</div>
            <div class="impact-item-label">Local employment, fair wages, cultural preservation, profit sharing</div>
          </div>
          <div class="impact-item">
            <div class="impact-item-icon" aria-hidden="true">&#127795;</div>
            <div class="impact-item-value">Biodiversity</div>
            <div class="impact-item-label">Habitat protection, wildlife corridors, restoration, species monitoring</div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Scoring Methodology</h3>
        <p>Scores are not self-reported. They are calculated from verified evidence using standardized criteria. For example, an Energy score of 90+ requires documented proof that at least 90% of the resort's electricity comes from on-site renewable sources, with independently verified generation data. A Community score of 90+ requires that at least 80% of staff are local hires earning above the regional living wage, with documented community benefit-sharing agreements.</p>
        <p>We also calculate a composite impact score, but we always display the individual dimension scores because the composite can mask important trade-offs. A resort scoring Energy: 95, Water: 90, Waste: 85, Community: 30, Biodiversity: 40 has an average of 68, which sounds decent but hides serious community and biodiversity problems.</p>

        <h3>Trade-Off Transparency</h3>
        <p>Every listing on EcoRenter includes a trade-off section. This is where we document the gaps, the weaknesses, and the areas where a resort falls short. We do this not to punish resorts but because travelers deserve the complete picture. A resort that is transparent about its weaknesses and working to improve them earns more respect in our system than one that hides its problems behind marketing.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Greenwashing in eco-tourism is the practice of making misleading claims about a resort's environmental practices to appear more sustainable than it actually is. Common examples include vague "eco-friendly" labels without measurable data, carbon offset claims without verification, towel reuse programs presented as major sustainability initiatives, and self-awarded eco-certifications with no third-party auditing. EcoRenter's evidence system is specifically designed to detect and filter out greenwashing.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" role="region">
              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>EcoRenter uses a four-tier evidence system. Tier A requires third-party certifications and independent audits from recognized bodies like GSTC or Rainforest Alliance. Tier B requires transparent operational documentation such as energy bills, water reports, and community payments. Tier C relies on verified traveler and NGO reports from people with firsthand experience. Tier D listings are never published because they failed verification. Each listed resort also receives an impact score across five dimensions: energy, water, waste, community, and biodiversity.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" role="region">
              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>EcoRenter scores every listed resort across five sustainability dimensions: Energy (renewable sources, efficiency, grid dependency), Water (conservation, harvesting, treatment, recycling), Waste (reduction, composting, recycling, plastic elimination), Community (local employment, fair wages, cultural preservation, profit sharing), and Biodiversity (habitat protection, wildlife corridors, restoration programs, species monitoring). Each dimension is scored from 0-100 based on verified evidence, not marketing claims.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Yes, and EcoRenter documents this transparently. No resort is perfect. A lodge might have excellent solar power (Energy: 95) but poor waste management (Waste: 40). A wildlife conservancy might score high on biodiversity (98) but lower on water conservation (60). EcoRenter's trade-off transparency means travelers see the complete picture, not just the highlights a resort would prefer to show.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">What is the difference between sustainable tourism and regenerative tourism?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" role="region">
              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Sustainable tourism aims to minimize negative impacts by reducing resource consumption, protecting ecosystems, and supporting local communities. Regenerative tourism goes further by actively improving the places visited. This includes restoring degraded ecosystems, revitalizing cultural traditions, strengthening local economies beyond pre-tourism levels, and sequestering more carbon than the operation produces. EcoRenter tracks both sustainable and regenerative practices across its database.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Travelers can verify sustainability claims by checking for recognized third-party certifications (GSTC-accredited, Rainforest Alliance, Green Globe), requesting specific data (percentage of renewable energy, liters of water saved, number of local employees), reading reviews from environmental NGOs, looking for published sustainability reports, and asking direct questions about waste management practices. EcoRenter's guides teach travelers exactly what questions to ask and what red flags to watch for.</p>
