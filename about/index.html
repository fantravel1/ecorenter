    <!-- The Problem: Greenwashing in Travel -->
    <section class="story-block" aria-labelledby="problem-heading">
      <div class="story-content">
        <span class="section-label">The Problem</span>
        <h2 id="problem-heading" style="font-size:1.6rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Greenwashing Is Stealing the Future of Sustainable Travel</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;line-height:1.8;">The word "eco" has become the most abused prefix in the travel industry. Slap it on a brochure, plant a few palms near the pool, and suddenly a resort that dumps untreated sewage into the ocean calls itself an "eco-lodge." This is not a fringe problem. Research from the International Ecotourism Society estimates that up to 40% of environmental claims made by accommodations worldwide are misleading, vague, or entirely fabricated.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;line-height:1.8;">For travelers who genuinely want to minimize their footprint, this creates an impossible information asymmetry. How do you tell the difference between a resort that spent millions on renewable energy infrastructure and one that spent thousands on a green marketing campaign? How do you know if "locally sourced" means the food came from a farm down the road or a warehouse in the capital city?</p>
        <blockquote class="story-quote">
          "We watched the word 'sustainable' get hollowed out by marketing departments until it meant nothing. EcoRenter exists to put the meaning back."
        </blockquote>
        <p class="story-attribution">&mdash; The EcoRenter Team</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;line-height:1.8;">The travel industry generates approximately 8% of global carbon emissions. Accommodations account for a significant slice. When travelers choose genuinely sustainable options, they redirect economic incentives toward conservation, renewable energy, and community well-being. But when greenwashing muddies the waters, those incentives evaporate. Money flows to the best marketers, not the best stewards. EcoRenter was built to fix that broken feedback loop.</p>

          <h2 id="mission-heading">Evidence Over Marketing. Transparency Over Promises.</h2>
          <p>EcoRenter exists to give travelers the unvarnished truth about where their money goes when they book a stay at an "eco" resort.</p>

          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Independent Intelligence</h3>
            <p>We are not a booking platform. We do not earn commissions. Our revenue model is entirely independent from resort marketing budgets, which means our assessments cannot be bought or influenced by the properties we evaluate.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Evidence-Based Verification</h3>
            <p>Every claim on EcoRenter is backed by verifiable evidence. We do not accept self-reported sustainability metrics at face value. We verify through certifications, documentation, community reports, and on-the-ground observations.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Trade-Off Transparency</h3>
            <p>No resort is perfect. An eco-lodge might have exceptional solar infrastructure but poor waste management. A community lodge might excel at local employment but lack renewable energy. We document every dimension honestly.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Accessible Knowledge</h3>
            <p>Sustainability data should not be locked behind paywalls or buried in academic journals. EcoRenter makes evidence-backed sustainability intelligence freely accessible to every traveler, everywhere.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Community-Centered</h3>
            <p>The communities hosting travelers are not a backdrop. They are stakeholders. We evaluate how resorts engage with local economies, respect indigenous cultures, and contribute to community development.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
            <p>Sustainability is not a destination; it is a direction. We regularly re-evaluate listings as new data emerges, practices evolve, and our methodology improves. A high score today does not guarantee a high score tomorrow.</p>

          <div style="line-height:1.9;font-size:1.05rem;">
            <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">We believe travel is one of the most powerful forces for human connection and environmental awareness. When done responsibly, it funds conservation, sustains communities, and transforms perspectives. When done carelessly, it extracts resources, displaces cultures, and accelerates ecological destruction.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">We believe the difference between responsible and irresponsible travel is not about guilt or sacrifice. It is about information. Travelers who have access to honest, evidence-backed sustainability data consistently make better choices. Not because they are forced to, but because they want to.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">We believe the travel industry can be a net positive force for the planet, but only if the market rewards genuine sustainability over green marketing. EcoRenter exists to correct the information asymmetry that currently allows greenwashing to thrive.</p>
            <p>We believe that digital nomads and remote workers represent the next generation of conscious travelers. By combining work flexibility with sustainability awareness, this community has the potential to redirect billions in travel spending toward regenerative economies. EcoRenter is built to serve that community with the depth and rigor they demand.</p>

          <span class="section-label">Our Methodology</span>
          <h2 id="methodology-heading">How We Verify Sustainability Claims</h2>
          <p>Every listing on EcoRenter passes through our multi-layered evidence framework. This is not a checklist. It is a rigorous evaluation process designed to separate genuine sustainability from marketing theater.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="philosophy-grid">
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Step 1: Initial Screening</h3>
            <p>Resorts enter our pipeline through nominations, community submissions, or our own research. We begin with a comprehensive review of publicly available sustainability claims, certifications, and operational documentation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Step 2: Evidence Collection</h3>
            <p>We gather evidence across five dimensions: energy sourcing, water management, waste handling, community impact, and biodiversity protection. Evidence must be verifiable through third-party sources, documentation, or community reports.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Step 3: Tier Classification</h3>
            <p>Based on evidence quality, each resort is classified into Tier A (certified and audited), Tier B (documented operations), Tier C (community verified), or Tier D (insufficient evidence, never published).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Step 4: Impact Scoring</h3>
            <p>Each verified resort receives impact scores across all five dimensions on a 0-100 scale. Scores reflect verified performance, not aspirational targets or future commitments. We score what is proven, not what is promised.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Step 5: Trade-Off Documentation</h3>
            <p>We document strengths and weaknesses transparently. A resort with exceptional renewable energy but poor waste management will have both facts clearly stated. No listing is portrayed as perfect if it is not.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Step 6: Ongoing Monitoring</h3>
            <p>Listings are reviewed periodically. Certifications expire, practices change, and new evidence emerges. Our database evolves with the facts. A resort can improve or decline in our assessments over time based on current evidence.</p>

        <div class="philosophy-grid">
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Radical Honesty</h3>
            <p>We tell the truth, even when it is uncomfortable. If a beloved eco-resort has genuine sustainability problems, we document them. If our own methodology has limitations, we acknowledge them publicly.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Scientific Rigor</h3>
            <p>We treat sustainability claims like scientific hypotheses: they require evidence to be accepted. Anecdotes are starting points for investigation, not substitutes for data.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Empathy for Travelers</h3>
            <p>We build for real people making real decisions with limited time and information. Our content is thorough but accessible, detailed but navigable, honest but never preachy.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Respect for Communities</h3>
            <p>Local communities are the front line of sustainable tourism. Their voices, experiences, and livelihoods are central to our evaluations. We listen before we assess.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Long-Term Thinking</h3>
            <p>We optimize for trust over traffic, accuracy over virality, and depth over breadth. Building the world's most trusted eco-resort database requires patience and consistency.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-item">
            <h3>Open Improvement</h3>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>EcoRenter uses a four-tier evidence system. Tier A requires third-party certifications and independent audits from recognized bodies like GSTC, Rainforest Alliance, or Green Globe. Tier B requires transparent operational documentation including energy bills, water usage reports, and community payment records. Tier C relies on verified reports from travelers, local communities, and NGOs. Tier D listings are never published due to failed verification or refusal to provide documentation. Each verified resort also receives impact scores across energy, water, waste, community, and biodiversity dimensions.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>Absolutely not. EcoRenter is completely independent from booking revenue and resort marketing budgets. No eco-resort can pay for placement, improved rankings, favorable reviews, or featured positions. Our listings are determined solely by evidence-backed sustainability data. This financial independence is fundamental to our mission of providing unbiased sustainability intelligence to travelers worldwide.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>EcoRenter addresses the widespread problem of greenwashing in the travel industry. Studies show that up to 40% of environmental claims by hotels and resorts are misleading or unsubstantiated. Travelers lack the tools to distinguish genuine sustainability from marketing spin. EcoRenter provides an independent, evidence-backed database so travelers can make truly informed decisions about where their money goes and how their stays affect local communities and ecosystems.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <p>EcoRenter is a progressive web app (PWA) optimized for mobile devices. You can add it to your home screen on any smartphone for an app-like experience, including offline access to previously viewed listings. The PWA approach aligns with our sustainability values by reducing the environmental footprint of app distribution. A dedicated native app is being considered for future phases, but the PWA provides full functionality across all devices today.</p>
